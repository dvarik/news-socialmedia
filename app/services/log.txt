MUST WATCH \nEditor says election coverage was a \'disgrace\' 04:48 Kushner credits the campaign\'s fundraising haul to machine learning. Per Forbes, his operation "(installed) digital marketing companies on a trading floor to make them compete for business. Ineffective ads were killed in minutes, while successful ones scaled. The campaign was sending more than 100,000 uniquely tweaked ads to targeted voters each day." Forbes reports Kushner\'s data operation ultimately made decisions about "travel, fundraising, advertising, rally locations--even the topics of the speeches," much like Hillary Clinton\'s algorithm-driven data efforts. He became indispensable to Trump and "wants to be an adviser" to the President-elect, per campaign manager Kellyanne Conway. Kushner also weighed in on support for the President-elect from white nationalist groups: "Trump has disavowed their support 25 times. He\'s renounced hatred, he\'s renounced bigotry, and he\'s renounced racism. I don\'t know if he could ever denounce them enough for some people." "If even the slightest infraction against what the speech police have deemed correct speech is instantly shouted down with taunts of \'racist,\' then what is left to condemn the actual racists?" said Kushner, who is Jewish. "You can\'t not be a racist for 69 years, then all of a sudden become a racist, right? You can\'t not be an anti-Semite for 69 years and all of a sudden become an anti-Semite because you\'re running."',

  text: 'As Treasury pick, Steven Mnuchin may get questions about how he ran his own bank by Chris Isidore @CNNMoney November 23, 2016: 6:48 AM ET Steve Mnuchin in 90 seconds Steven Mnuchin is one of Donald Trump\'s top picks to be Treasury secretary, but if he\'s chosen he\'ll face some tough questions about how he ran his own bank. \nSources tell CNN that Mnuchin is one of two leading candidates for Treasury secretary, among the most important and powerful members of the cabinet. Besides serving as the nation\'s banker, paying its bills, collecting taxes and managing its debt, the secretary is also one of the leading regulators of banks and Wall Street. \nWhen Mnuchin bought California subprime mortgage lender IndyMac , it was one of the financial crisis\' high-profile bank failures. He could face some heat over the fact that he made billions thanks to the generous terms of the deal with the FDIC. He may also face questions about some of the practices at the bank, which later admitted to regulators that it failed to follow protocol when it foreclosed on homeowners struggling with risky mortgages. \nRelated: Trump market euphoria forgets scary campaign promises \nIndyMac was one of the nation\'s a leading subprime home loan lenders before it failed in July 2008. Mnuchin was not involved in making the risky loans that caused the bank to collapse. But his March 2009 purchase of IndyMac, which he renamed OneWest, made him and his fellow investors very, very wealthy. Mnuchin was lead investor of the group. \nAll together they put up $1.55 billion, according to the FDIC -- pennies on the dollar for the assets being acquired. Mnuchin eventually sold it for more than twice that amount in 2015. The fact that the FDIC agreed to cover the overwhelming majority of IndyMac\'s losses on bad loans when Mnunchin bought it helped make the bank very profitable during his ownership. \nAlso during his tenure, OneWest was charged by federal regulators with filing false documents during foreclosures. Employees also failed to make sure they had the correct loan documentation before the bank seized a home. The scandal, which became known as robo-signing , reached many other major backs as well. OneWest eventually admitted its wrongdoing in a consent decree with regulators. \nAs the housing market stabilized and rebounded, the bank grew to one of the largest in southern California, partly through the purchase of other smaller, failed banks. In 2015, CIT Group bought the bank for $3.4 billion in cash and stock. CIT itself received a government bailout worth $2.3 billion in 2008, and avoided repaying taxpayers when it filed for bankruptcy a year later. \nRelated: Businessman Wilbur Ross is a leading candidate for commerce \nIn addition, two fair housing groups in California recently filed new complaints with Department of Housing and Urban Development just this month accusing the bank, now known as CIT Bank, of discriminating against minority home buyers and neighborhoods. \nOne group charges that in 2014 and 2015, OneWest offered just two mortgage loans to African American borrowers in the area reviewed by the groups. The complaint also claims that the bank "has sited and maintained branches in a way that avoids neighborhoods of color and minority census tracts." Finally, it charges that foreclosed homes owned by the bank in minority neighborhoods were in a much greater state of disrepair compared to the foreclosures it owned in white neighborhoods. \nCIT told CNNMoney that it "is committed to fair lending and works hard to meet the credit needs of all communities and neighborhoods we serve." Mnuchin could not be reached for comment. \n--CNNMoney\'s Danielle Wiener-Bronner contributed to this story. CNNMoney (New York) First published November 23, 2016: 6:48 AM ET',

By Reed Alexander and James Griffiths , CNN Updated 0903 GMT (1703 HKT) November 23, 2016 \nChat with us in Facebook Messenger. Find out what\'s happening in the world as it unfolds. Three people died in Victoria, Australia, as a result of "thunderstorm asthma". Story highlights Thunderstorm asthma caused by series of freak weather conditions Grass pollen entering people\'s lungs makes it difficult for them to breathe (CNN) A "perfect storm" of weather conditions leading to a freak illness known as thunderstorm asthma has left three people dead in Australia. Hundreds of people were rushed to hospital Monday with breathing problems in the southern Australian state of Victoria as emergency services struggled to cope. During a four hour period Monday, Ambulance Victoria received more than 1,900 calls, or one call every four to five seconds. An extra 60 ambulances were deployed, as well as police and firefighters. Two people have died in Melbourne in a rare weather phenomenon called "Thunderstorm Asthma." #7News https://t.co/vSggnNfVOD — 7 News Queensland (@7NewsQueensland) November 22, 2016 Freak incident Thunderstorm asthma occurs when a storm hits during a period of unusually high rye grass pollen, said Robin Ould, chief executive of the Asthma Foundation of Australia. Read More "When you have a perfect storm coming together (of) a very high pollen day, high humidity, and a thunderstorm, the grains of rye grass absorb water with the humidity and they break up into thousands of pieces," Ould said. "Normally with rye grass the pollen would be trapped by nose hairs. When it breaks up it goes straight to the lungs." The pollen irritates the lungs\' bronchial tubes, causing them to become inflamed and filled with mucus and making it hard for people to breathe. Pollen levels peak in late spring. When this combines with strong winds, rain and high temperatures, as it did in Victoria this week, it can lead to incidents of thunderstorm asthma. Edward Newbigin, a professor of biosciences at the University of Melbourne, said that many of those affected may never have had an asthma attack before. "I imagine it was absolutely terrifying," he said. Of more than 2,500 people surveyed by the university, 74% said they experienced asthma during the storm. Of those, 32% had never experienced an asthma attack before. \'Absolute shock\' One of the dead, 18-year-old Omar Moujalled, had just finished his final year of studies at Melbourne\'s Australian International Academy. 18-year-old Omar Moujalled was one of the victims of a "thunderstorm asthma" incident in Victoria, Australia on November 21, 2016. His friend Shuayb Talic told CNN the news left him in "absolute shock, denial, then horror." "Omar was the fittest of the group," Talic said. "We were discussing a gym meet up just a few days earlier. However, he did have asthma, and apparently it was so severe during the storm he could barely stand up to treat it." Apollo Papadopoulos, 35, and Hope Carnevali, 20, also died during the storm. Carnevali passed away in the arms of her family members after waiting more than 40 minutes for an ambulance, according to CNN affiliate 7 News Australia . Apollo Papadopoulos and Hope Carnevali died of breathing complications due to "thunderstorm asthma." Rare illness Thunderstorm asthma last struck Victoria in May 2010, but the condition is not limited to Australia. Newbigin said incidents of thunderstorm asthma have been seen in the UK, Italy and Canada, but the condition is "very under reported." People with hay fever are particularly at risk, Newbigin said. He advised them to "better manage your hay fever during the pollen season," by using antihistamines, eye drops and other medications. Though normally hay fever occurs in the nasal area, the freak weather conditions which cause thunderstorm asthma can drive the allergens deep into the lungs, causing a far more severe asthmatic attack.

  text: 'Story highlights Robert Klitzman: Psychological research suggests that we all seek a means of symbolic immortality Many of us have difficulty grasping the apparent finality of death, Klitzman writes Robert Klitzman is a professor of psychiatry and director of the Masters of Bioethics Program at Columbia University. He is author of " The Ethics Police?: The Struggle to Make Human Research Safe ." The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.\n(CNN) A physician who had been diagnosed with cancer once told me that, before he became sick, patients would periodically ask him, "Doc, will you pray for me?"\n"I\'d \'pooh-pooh\' the idea," the physician told me. "Then, I became sick, and realized how important spirituality was in patients\' lives." Robert Klitzman I heard such stories again and again as I was interviewing physicians for a book, " When Doctors Become Patients ." Doctors facing the prospect of their own death would tell me how they finally began to truly understand the vital roles played by spirituality and religion in many patients\' lives. I was reminded of these conversations when I read the news of a 14-year-old girl who had died of cancer, but who had asked that her body be cryopreserved after her death in the hope that one day she might be cured. I can only begin to imagine what the girl -- known only as "JS" to protect her privacy -- and her parents must have felt. Her parents were divorced, and while her mother supported her wish to be frozen, her father had opposed it. The cost of the procedure in this case, according to the judge, is about $45,000. The case went to court, and the judge ruled in JS\'s favor. Read More The girl\'s wish to continue to live is, of course, not surprising. After all, death is arguably the greatest tragedy of life, and something that most of us try at all costs to avoid. And the death of a child is generally even more disturbing than that of an adult -- all living things eventually die, but it feels like a child has been cheated of a full life. So I am sure that the thought that JS might one day come back to life greatly comforted her and her mother. Sadly, cryopreservation of bodies has never been shown to work. No one has ever been frozen and then come back to life when thawed. Of course, proponents argue that eventually medical science will indeed figure out how to make it work. And the lack of success so far has not stopped some 250 people from being cryonically preserved in the United States, according to one study . But even if cryopreservation could work, in say 100, 200 or 300 years, it would raise a number of important issues and questions. For a start, everyone the frozen person knows will long since be gone. The world will be a very different place. Climate change may have destroyed many of the world\'s major cities. Where would the thawed people live? How would they support themselves? These questions might seem self-evident, and nix any interest in cryonics. Yet the idea -- and, to some, the appeal -- of the process persists. Why? For a start, stories of the dead coming back to life or achieving immortality fill our religions and myths -- from Jesus to Orpheus (who descended to the underworld to bring back his deceased beloved), Sir Galahad and Frankenstein. When I attended medical school, the gates of a nearby cemetery proclaimed words from Corinthians, "The Dead Will Be Raised." Psychological research suggests that we all seek means of symbolic immortality -- a sense that we can somehow transcend the mortal confines of our lives -- through religion (a sense of the afterlife), our children, our creative work, or "experiential transcendence" ("drugs and sex and rock \'n\' roll"). In my reform Jewish Sunday school, I was taught that when we die, "We still live on Earth in the good deeds we have done, and in the hearts of those who cherished us." In short, many of us have difficulty grasping the apparent finality of death. Critics argue that as a society, we engage in widespread denial of death -- overly focusing on youthfulness, and discriminating against the elderly. Similarly, after many people\'s hearts or brains have failed, we often keep these individuals alive on machines, at great costs. Indeed, one study suggested that "one out of every four Medicare dollars, more than $125 billion, is spent on services for the 5% of beneficiaries in their last year of life." Most individuals, if asked hypothetically, would likely prefer to have that money used in other ways -- for their own or their children\'s or grandchildren\'s education, for example. Yet many people still work to delay their own death, or that of loved ones, for as long as they can. Follow CNN Opinion Join us on Twitter and Facebook\nUltimately, none of us knows what happens when we die. I am sure that the thought of coming back to life gave JS immense solace. If so, I am glad. But as adults, we should, I would argue, try to find better ways to accept more fully the finality of death here on Earth, whether symbolically or through other means. Seneca, the ancient Roman writer, said we should live each day of our lives as if it may be the last -- because it indeed may be. And that might be the biggest lesson of these stories that we hear about cryogenics and expanding use of end-of-life machines -- that it is not so much about the science, but about living life to the fullest while we are here. That\'s something we should all work on together.',

"The President always said he expected a reciprocity from Washington," Peskov added. "Now we know that our bilateral relations are at the bottom so it\'s hard to make them worse, but we certainly hope for resuming a dialogue and we\'ll start a difficult and slow process of bringing the relations back to a constructive course." Improving US ties with Russia was a key plank of US President-elect Donald Trump\'s foreign policy during the election campaign. Fresh start?

  text: 'How to fly for Thanksgiving without freaking out by Jon Ostrower @jonostrower November 23, 2016: 8:19 AM ET Chicago O\'Hare employees vote to strike Well, it\'s that time again. You and your closest 27 million friends and family members are flying for Thanksgiving. \nThe crush, which started on Friday, runs through Sunday. Here\'s your guide to not only survive, but thrive, as you conquer the airport. \n1. Leave enough time \nOnline check-in begins 24 hours before departure, and most airlines recommend you get to the airport no less than two hours before your scheduled departure. Bottom line: The more time you have, the more time to adjust if your plans are disrupted. #TravelTip Increased passenger traffic projected for #LGA during the #thanksgiving travel period. Leave extra time. https://t.co/p3L8mzM77O pic.twitter.com/6CtwRxbeAS \nThe good news is that your chances of arriving on time are better than ever. According to the Department of Transportation, airlines canceled 0.3% of scheduled domestic flights in September, the lowest rate since 1995. \n2. Know your rights on overbooking \nU.S. airlines have been steadily increasing capacity, but that doesn\'t mean your flight won\'t be overbooked and you may get bumped. Department of Transportation has outlined the rules that airlines have to follow when bumping passengers. Know your rights as a traveler. \n3. What happens if your plans are disrupted \nDownload your airline\'s app on your phone or tablet. Many will help you find alternate flights and rebookings. Ultimately you can skip waiting in line at the airport or hanging on hold over the phone. \nYou can call in outside help, too. Cranky Concierge , a service run by travel expert and airline blogger Brett Snyder, can monitor your travels, watching for delays and prepare alternate flight options. \n4. Charge your batteries \nMany airlines now offer in-seat power, but make sure your devices are charged before you fly. And if you want to be an airport superhero, pack a power strip. \nMany older aircraft have also gotten new seats with power and in-flight entertainment screens. \n5. Keep entertained \nWifi internet access is now available on most U.S. mainline flights for an added fee and free on airlines like JetBlue Airways ( JBLU ) . While internet may cost you, airlines like American ( AAL ) , Southwest ( LUV ) , Delta ( DAL ) and United offer on-board servers that stream content to your devices for free. \nYou can typically get access to free -- or paid -- streaming content with an airline\'s app. Access to streaming services on airlines like American and Alaska Airlines are offered through the Gogo In-Flight Entertainment App. \nIf all else fails, raise that window shade and enjoy the view. Or strike up a conversation with your seatmate, just don\'t talk about politics. \n6. Be good to each other \nI\'ll leave you with this. Be good to your fellow travelers, airline and airport staff. While they, too, may be grumpy from a constant onslaught of travel madness, a smile goes a long, long way. \nSafe travels. ',

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) By taking the trouble of organizing a motorcade to make the 1.4 mile-trip from his Manhattan home to the headquarters of The New York Times, President-elect Donald Trump made a telling break with the choreography of the transition. The Times, arguably the world\'s most powerful news organization, is an institution to which even an American president must pay a degree of respect. Up to now, Trump, ever the showman, has created a spectacle by making followers, advisers job-seekers and other supplicants travel to Trump Tower or to Trump\'s golf club in New Jersey to talk about the administration he is forming. There is little secrecy to the process: Banks of news cameras have been on hand to record aspirants\' arrivals at Trump Tower, and C-SPAN even set up a static camera shot recording the building\'s elevator bank, so that anyone can go online and see who\'s coming and going.

Otto was moving west-northwest at 5 mph, packing maximum sustained winds of 75 mph. Otto could become a Category 2 storm before making landfall near the Costa Rica-Nicaragua border around noon ET Thursday. Rainfall in the region could exceed 10-15 inches, producing life-threatening flash flooding and landslides. Hurricane warnings have been issued for parts of both countries. Peak of hurricane season in the Atlantic While the Caribbean is one of the few areas with warm enough water to support a hurricane this late in the season, a storm making landfall this far south is extremely rare This portion of Central America is unaccustomed to hurricane landfalls. It also has steep terrain, which makes the area prone to flooding and landslides from a slow-moving storm like Otto. Read More Track the storm here Otto formed in the southern Caribbean early this week. The storm has steadily strengthened and on Tuesday afternoon became the seventh hurricane of the season in the Atlantic basin. Otto is developing later in the season than any Atlantic basin hurricane since Hurricane Epsilon in 2005. It is the latest hurricane to form in the Caribbean, supplanting Hurricane Martha of 1969 in the record book. Otto is expected to be the southernmost hurricane landfall since Irene hit Nicaragua in 1971. If it makes landfall in Nicaragua it will be the first hurricane to do so since Ida in 2009. 2016 Named storms of the Atlantic season If Otto makes landfall in Costa Rica, it will be that country\'s first hurricane landfall in recorded history (since 1851).

  text: 'Story highlights Protesters and police have conflicting accounts about the cause of an explosion that maimed an activist Construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline has been suspended pending talks with Native American leaders\n(CNN) Protesters have tried to stop the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline since late last summer. They\'ve voiced environmental concerns. They\'ve performed sacred rituals. They\'ve stood in solidarity with a Native American group seeking to be heard.\nOn Sunday night, 400 protesters clashed with police, leading to the hospitalization of more than two dozen. One protester, a 21-year-old New York resident named Sophia Wilansky, nearly lost her arm after an explosion. How did it happen? Both sides have blamed each since the weekend clashes. Billion-dollar brouhaha The proposed Dakota Access Pipeline, which is set to cost $3.7 billion, would start in North Dakota, stretch across parts of South Dakota and Iowa and end in southern Illinois. If completed, the pipeline would allow crude oil to be transported to oil refineries along the Eastern Seaboard. Read More Wilansky was among the protesters Sunday who rallied in solidarity with the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. Members of the tribe, whose reservation is near the project\'s path, believe the pipeline would affect its supply of drinking water and place downstream communities at risk of contamination from potential oil spills. The US Army Corps of Engineers granted the project final permits in July -- to the dismay of environmentalists and tribe members. Michael Knudsen, medical logistics coordinator for the Standing Rock Medic and Healer Council, told CNN that demonstrators on Sunday had attempted to pull a truck off of the Backwater Bridge to clear a roadblock that "prevented people from being evacuated in an emergency." Knudsen said he saw police unleash water cannons on protesters even though temperatures were below freezing. They also shot rubber bullets and tear gas toward the crowd. "It was horrific," one protester told CNN. "It was a horrific scene." JUST WATCHED Built on sacred land: \'It\'s going to be a battle\' Replay More Videos ...

Wilansky had been handing out bottles of water to protesters when a grenade landed near her forearm. Suddenly, it detonated, according to witnesses. "She was air lifted to County Medical Center in Minneapolis were she\'s currently undergoing extensive, hours-long surgery from injuries sustained from the blast," said a GoFundMe page raising money for her medical costs. JUST WATCHED Violence at Dakota Pipeline protest site Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nViolence at Dakota Pipeline protest site 00:52 Initially, protesters feared the worst: Doctors would have to amputate her arm due to the explosion. But Wayne Wilansky, Sophia\'s father, told CNN affiliate KFYR that amputation wouldn\'t be necessary even though the explosion "blew the bone out of her arm." Wilansky noted his daughter, who might need as many as 20 surgeries to repair her forearm, still remained focused on the pipeline fight. "Even though she\'s lying there with her arm pretty much blown off, she\'s focused on the fact that it\'s not about her, it\'s about what we\'re doing to our country, what we\'re doing to our native peoples, what we\'re doing to our environment," Wayne Wilansky said. Police: We didn\'t fire grenades at protesters On Tuesday, North Dakota State Patrol spokesman Lt. Tom Iverson told CNN affiliate KFYR that state troopers had not deployed a grenade or any other explosive against protesters on Sunday. "There is no merit to that," Iverson said."But I assure the citizens of North Dakota ... that law enforcement is investigating this. All the facts will be out there." The North Dakota Joint Information Center also released photos of improvised weapons that law enforcement said protesters used against them during the confrontation at Backwater Bridge.

According to KFYR, police say protesters were seen running to the area where the explosion had happened. The group pulled a female from under a burned vehicle on the bridge, then fled, authorities said. \'There are many witnesses\' However, Wayne Wilansky questioned Iverson\'s contention that police refrained from using grenades. "There are many witnesses," Wilansky said. "They have scrap metal, and the sheriff\'s office says they did it to themselves -- that they blew up their own bombs or something. That\'s ridiculous."

  text: 'MUST WATCH Mother of bus crash victim breaks down 02:15 What we know: Of the five Woodmore Elementary School students confirmed dead, three were fourth-graders, one was a first-grader and one was a kindergartner. One of them was D\'Myunn Brown, 6, whose mother told HLN that he was an outgoing boy. He loved to talk and dance to the latest YouTube videos. Before the crash, students celebrated Thanksgiving during lunchtime Monday, with one of the teachers taking a picture of one of the children who later did not survive. That photo was used to help identify the victim. Injuries sustained by children on the bus included broken limbs, traumatic head and spinal injuries, and cuts and bruises, according to Erlanger Children\'s Hospital. What we don\'t know: The identities of all of the victims. The driver What we know: Johnthony Walker, 24, has been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving. He could face more charges as the investigation unfolds. Bus driver Johnthony Walker has been charged with vehicular homicide. "Mr. Walker lost control of the bus and swerved off of the roadway to the right, striking an elevated driveway and mailbox, swerved to the left and began to overturn, striking a telephone pole and a tree," according to the arrest affidavit. After the accident, Walker called his mother, Gwenevere Cook. She said her son tried to get the children off the bus. Cook described Walker as a responsible man who took care of his 3-year-old son. A co-worker at his other job at Amazon told CNN affiliate WSMV that Walker worked two jobs to take care of his son. "The picture that you paint of someone who\'d do something like this is not the vibe I got from him," Breena Ross told the station. "He was respectable. Just a very nice person." She added that he\'d often come to work tired. What we don\'t know: The results of tests on a blood sample from Walker that has been sent to the state lab for processing. Were there factors, such as fatigue or distractions, that may have affected his driving? His driving record What we know: Walker received his commercial driving license in April, according to the NTSB. In September, Walker was driving a school bus when he hit another vehicle, causing minor damage. The accident report cited Walker for "failure to yield right of way." The driver in the other vehicle, in an interview with the Chattanooga Times Free Press , alleged that the school bus went through a stop sign and scraped her car. Also in 2013, Walker was cited for failure to show proof of insurance. His driver\'s license was suspended for three weeks. It was reinstated in late March 2014, according to state records. What we don\'t know: What kind of vetting and training did Walker go through to become a school bus driver? How did the bus company investigate the September incident that Walker was involved in? Have there been prior complaints or issues reported about his driving to the company? The bus What we know: The bus did not have seat belts. But NTSB\'s chairman Christopher Hart said it takes more than seat belts to prevent injuries. NTSB Chairman Hart & Go-team examine the scene of school bus crash #chattanoogabuscrash pic.twitter.com/vshYBh0rXW What we don\'t know: Could seat belts on the school bus have prevented the deaths and injuries? The NTSB will be looking into what else could have been done to lessen the extent of the damage and injuries. Was there any mechanical issues with the bus? The bus company What we know: The company that operated the bus and employed Walker has come under scrutiny. Durham School Services, a company that transports more than 1 million students daily at schools across the United States, is contracted by Hamilton County. "Our entire team at Durham School Services is devastated by the accident yesterday that tragically claimed the lives of Chattanooga students," the company said in a statement . What we don\'t know: Was there proper oversight? CNN\'s Devon Sayers, Catherine Shoichet and Martin Savidge contributed to this report.',

One of the young victims was D\'Myunn Brown, 6. His mother had met him at the bus stop each day and so she knew exactly where he sat. "He was my only child," she sobbed. Brown had recently returned home to D\'Myunn after serving a five-year prison sentence. D\'Myunn was just 1 year old when his mother went away. At Erlanger Children\'s Hospital, children were treated for minor injuries, such as bruises and cuts, as well as broken limbs and traumatic head and spinal injuries, Erlanger Health System Senior Vice President Jan Keys said. Staff treated and released 19 patients Monday. As of Tuesday afternoon, 12 patients remained, six in critical care and six stable. Mourning At sunset the community filled the New Monumental Baptist Church across the elementary School for a vigil. Hundreds of mourners filled the pews. They cried and raised their hands in prayer as they sang of how God is in control, and that no matter how bleak the situation, things will get better. Some people are standing outside of the church.

"We love the children of Woodmore with all our hearts. We will grieve together and honor our children\'s lives," Hamilton County Interim Superintendent Kirk Kelly said. Bus driver\'s mother asks for compassion The NTSB plans to speak with the driver, who has been charged with five counts of vehicular homicide, reckless endangerment and reckless driving. Walker received his commercial driver\'s license in April, Hart said. Since then, records show he received a traffic citation for side-swiping a car in September while driving a school bus. After the crash, Walker\'s mother said she got a phone call from her son, who told her he\'d been in a "drastic accident" and tried to explain what had happened before police took his phone away. Chattanooga residents rush to give blood after bus crash "He was trying to get them (children) off the bus -- all the bodies were limp," Gwenevere Cook said . "There was blood everywhere. He has been cooperating with the police. He texted me minutes later saying the kids are dead." Cook expressed condolences to the victims\' families and asked for compassion for her son, describing him as a respected man and a father of a 3-year-old son who worked two jobs and had never been in trouble before. "It is a horrible nightmare," Cook said. "I feel bad for my son, and I am torn up for the (victims\') family members." Questions about the bus company The company that operated the bus and employed Walker has come under scrutiny. Durham School Services, a company that transports more than 1 million students daily at schools across the United States, said it was working with police and school officials to investigate. Neither the city of Chattanooga nor its schools interacts with the company, Chattanooga Mayor Berke said. Hamilton County runs the bus system. "Our entire team at Durham School Services is devastated by the accident yesterday that tragically claimed the lives of Chattanooga students," the company\'s statement said .

Find out what\'s happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED A botched drug raid in 2006 resulted in Kathryn Johnston\'s death Reforms have helped bridge the divide between community and police Atlanta (CNN) Before #BlackLivesMatter became a trending hashtag, before names like Michael Brown, Laquan McDonald and Walter Scott filled national headlines, before protesters took to the streets of Charlotte and Baltimore, Atlanta Police had a moment of reckoning. Several officers killed an elderly woman named Kathryn Johnston in a botched drug raid. Johnston\'s death, which occurred 10 years ago this week, forced the Atlanta Police Department to undergo a major series of reforms. But did reforms actually change anything? We revisited the case -- talking with officials, activists, and police about the shooting -- to see how Johnston\'s death impacted Atlanta. Kathryn Johnston was shot and killed in a botched APD drug raid. Why did Kathryn Johnston die? On a rainy Tuesday evening, two days before Thanksgiving 2006, Kathryn Johnston, a lively 88-year-old black woman, was inside her yellow brick ranch at 933 Neal Street. Her family was planning to come by for their annual feast. Read More Johnston had lived near English Avenue since the late \'80s. Since then, the historic neighborhood where black working-class families once prospered had fallen on hard times. It became known as the "The Bluff" and had turned into the South\'s largest open-air heroin market, according to the FBI. Kathryn Johnston\'s house remains vacant 10 years after her death. Johnston, used to the drugs and prostitutes, felt unsafe after an elderly woman had recently been raped. A friend came over to clean her old .38 revolver. She wouldn\'t be taking any chances. Around 7 p.m., eight Atlanta Police officers approached Johnston\'s property without warning. They pried off burglar bars attached to the wooden door and used a ram to bust inside. Johnston, who had grabbed her gun, fired a single shot that zipped past the police. APD officers unleashed a hail of gunfire, 39 bullets in total. Five pierced her body. "They shot her down like a dog," Sarah Dozier, Johnston\'s niece, told reporters outside Grady Memorial Hospital. It was a botched drug raid that went horribly wrong -- police knowingly acted based on false pretenses, and then tried to cover up their actions. Johnston\'s death grabbed international headlines, prompted a civil rights probe, and led to a congressional hearing. Three APD officers pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death. They went to prison. "People in communities of color believed officers in certain APD departments operated as a band of thugs," civil rights attorney Mawuli Davis said. "The exposure was too much to turn a blind eye." Following Johnston\'s death, local officials pledged to review practices and make reforms. It all happened years before police shooting victims\' names were popularized into hashtags -- all while hundreds of other minority men and women became victims of police brutality. A decade later, the department\'s changes have largely spared Atlanta the anger and conflict that followed police-involved deaths in such cities as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland. "Her killing was heart-wrenching and tragic," said former Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin, who oversaw the changes after Johnston\'s death. "The expressions of horror helped all of us in Atlanta refocus on the value of human life." \'A complicated set of errors\' On the afternoon of November 21, 2006, narcotics officer Jason Smith was feeling pressure to meet his unwritten quota of nine arrests and two executed search warrants each month, federal investigators learned while interviewing APD officers. According to a report from the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, Smith and two other APD officers -- Gregg Junnier and Arthur Tesler -- told federal investigators such quotas were in place. APD has long denied such a policy was ever enforced. The three officers detained a suspected drug dealer named Fabian Sheets, according to court filings. After a search turned up nothing of substance, Smith planted marijuana near Sheets, which a canine officer then found, an FBI investigation revealed. Faced with the threat of a lengthy prison sentence Sheets told the officers he knew of a kilo of cocaine that could be found inside a shoebox at 933 Neal Street -- Johnston\'s address. The tip had the potential, if true, to yield one of APD\'s biggest seizures of the year. The officers submitted paperwork for a "no-knock" search warrant -- which would permit them to enter the house without warning. A judge quickly approved the warrant. The raid was on. There was just one problem: The paperwork said a man named "Sam" had sold two $25 baggies of crack to a confidential informant at 933 Neal Street. That informant, a drug dealer named Alexis White, didn\'t actually buy the drugs. White told federal investigators he was asked to make a buy for APD, but he couldn\'t get there in time because he didn\'t have a ride. The plain-clothed officers busted down the door anyway. From the archive: Informant denies buying drugs Images from the night of the raid show the ensuing investigation. After Johnston\'s death, they planted marijuana in the slain woman\'s home. Smith, Junnier and Tesler tried to persuade White to cover for them, the FBI found, even paying him $100 and getting him to sign a backdated voucher for the fake drug purchase. Soon, it all unraveled. White, fearful of retribution from officers for failing to corroborate their story, reached out to a TV reporter to expose the officers. It would lead to a joint investigation among state and federal authorities. "It was such a complicated set of errors," Loyola Law School professor Alexandra Natapoff said. "It was a terrible yet perfect example of all the things that could go wrong." In 2009, all three APD officers were sentenced for conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death and received prison sentences between five and 10 years, along with three years of supervised release. They had to pay a total of $8,180 to cover Johnston\'s funeral costs. "This is a sad day in the law enforcement community," Gregory Jones, the FBI\'s lead special agent on the investigation, said in a statement. "Few crimes are as reprehensible as those committed by police officers who violate the very laws they have sworn to uphold." The city of Atlanta eventually paid $4.9 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Johnston\'s family following her death. From the archive: Cops apologize for deadly drug raid \'They blew it up, started over\' George Turner, who today is the APD police chief, headed up recruitment and training efforts at the time of Johnston\'s death. The Atlanta native, raised in a public housing project a few miles away from Johnston\'s house, was dismayed to watch the relationship between police and residents fray following the raid. "It was really an extreme black eye for our city," the 35-year APD veteran recalled. By 2008, FBI investigators had found that systemic problems that extended beyond three "rogue" officers. There was a widespread "culture of misconduct" that plagued much of the department, investigators said. It matters what police are thinking (Opinion) Then-APD Chief Richard Pennington would ultimately reassign his remaining narcotics officers, rebuilding the unit from scratch. He expanded the unit from eight members to 30 members. Each received rigorous training. The shake-up followed a pledge to review policies surrounding the use of informants and the use of "no-knock" warrants. "They did not take it lightly," Georgia State University criminal justice professor Dean Dabney said. "They blew it up, started over and put their best people in charge -- ethical leaders who cleaned up messes." In addition, Johnston\'s death prompted city officials to establish an independent board of citizens tasked with reviewing allegations of police misconduct. Lee Reid, the board\'s executive director, said the entity has both investigated complaints against officers and helped shape policies including body camera procedures. "If there\'s one good thing to come out of Kathryn Johnston\'s death, there\'s a greater commitment to holding APD and officials accountable," Reid said.

  text: 'Story highlights A botched drug raid in 2006 resulted in Kathryn Johnston\'s death Reforms have helped bridge the divide between community and police Atlanta (CNN) Before #BlackLivesMatter became a trending hashtag, before names like Michael Brown, Laquan McDonald and Walter Scott filled national headlines, before protesters took to the streets of Charlotte and Baltimore, Atlanta Police had a moment of reckoning. \nSeveral officers killed an elderly woman named Kathryn Johnston in a botched drug raid. Johnston\'s death, which occurred 10 years ago this week, forced the Atlanta Police Department to undergo a major series of reforms. But did reforms actually change anything? We revisited the case -- talking with officials, activists, and police about the shooting -- to see how Johnston\'s death impacted Atlanta. Kathryn Johnston was shot and killed in a botched APD drug raid. Why did Kathryn Johnston die? On a rainy Tuesday evening, two days before Thanksgiving 2006, Kathryn Johnston, a lively 88-year-old black woman, was inside her yellow brick ranch at 933 Neal Street. Her family was planning to come by for their annual feast. Read More Johnston had lived near English Avenue since the late \'80s. Since then, the historic neighborhood where black working-class families once prospered had fallen on hard times. It became known as the "The Bluff" and had turned into the South\'s largest open-air heroin market, according to the FBI. Kathryn Johnston\'s house remains vacant 10 years after her death. Johnston, used to the drugs and prostitutes, felt unsafe after an elderly woman had recently been raped. A friend came over to clean her old .38 revolver. She wouldn\'t be taking any chances. Around 7 p.m., eight Atlanta Police officers approached Johnston\'s property without warning. They pried off burglar bars attached to the wooden door and used a ram to bust inside. Johnston, who had grabbed her gun, fired a single shot that zipped past the police. APD officers unleashed a hail of gunfire, 39 bullets in total. Five pierced her body. "They shot her down like a dog," Sarah Dozier, Johnston\'s niece, told reporters outside Grady Memorial Hospital. It was a botched drug raid that went horribly wrong -- police knowingly acted based on false pretenses, and then tried to cover up their actions. Johnston\'s death grabbed international headlines, prompted a civil rights probe, and led to a congressional hearing. Three APD officers pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death. They went to prison. "People in communities of color believed officers in certain APD departments operated as a band of thugs," civil rights attorney Mawuli Davis said. "The exposure was too much to turn a blind eye." Following Johnston\'s death, local officials pledged to review practices and make reforms. It all happened years before police shooting victims\' names were popularized into hashtags -- all while hundreds of other minority men and women became victims of police brutality. A decade later, the department\'s changes have largely spared Atlanta the anger and conflict that followed police-involved deaths in such cities as Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, Maryland. "Her killing was heart-wrenching and tragic," said former Atlanta Mayor Shirley Franklin, who oversaw the changes after Johnston\'s death. "The expressions of horror helped all of us in Atlanta refocus on the value of human life." \'A complicated set of errors\' On the afternoon of November 21, 2006, narcotics officer Jason Smith was feeling pressure to meet his unwritten quota of nine arrests and two executed search warrants each month, federal investigators learned while interviewing APD officers. According to a report from the Atlanta Citizen Review Board, Smith and two other APD officers -- Gregg Junnier and Arthur Tesler -- told federal investigators such quotas were in place. APD has long denied such a policy was ever enforced. The three officers detained a suspected drug dealer named Fabian Sheets, according to court filings. After a search turned up nothing of substance, Smith planted marijuana near Sheets, which a canine officer then found, an FBI investigation revealed. Faced with the threat of a lengthy prison sentence Sheets told the officers he knew of a kilo of cocaine that could be found inside a shoebox at 933 Neal Street -- Johnston\'s address. The tip had the potential, if true, to yield one of APD\'s biggest seizures of the year. The officers submitted paperwork for a "no-knock" search warrant -- which would permit them to enter the house without warning. A judge quickly approved the warrant. The raid was on. There was just one problem: The paperwork said a man named "Sam" had sold two $25 baggies of crack to a confidential informant at 933 Neal Street. That informant, a drug dealer named Alexis White, didn\'t actually buy the drugs. White told federal investigators he was asked to make a buy for APD, but he couldn\'t get there in time because he didn\'t have a ride. The plain-clothed officers busted down the door anyway. From the archive: Informant denies buying drugs Images from the night of the raid show the ensuing investigation. After Johnston\'s death, they planted marijuana in the slain woman\'s home. Smith, Junnier and Tesler tried to persuade White to cover for them, the FBI found, even paying him $100 and getting him to sign a backdated voucher for the fake drug purchase. Soon, it all unraveled. White, fearful of retribution from officers for failing to corroborate their story, reached out to a TV reporter to expose the officers. It would lead to a joint investigation among state and federal authorities. "It was such a complicated set of errors," Loyola Law School professor Alexandra Natapoff said. "It was a terrible yet perfect example of all the things that could go wrong." In 2009, all three APD officers were sentenced for conspiracy to violate civil rights resulting in death and received prison sentences between five and 10 years, along with three years of supervised release. They had to pay a total of $8,180 to cover Johnston\'s funeral costs. "This is a sad day in the law enforcement community," Gregory Jones, the FBI\'s lead special agent on the investigation, said in a statement. "Few crimes are as reprehensible as those committed by police officers who violate the very laws they have sworn to uphold." The city of Atlanta eventually paid $4.9 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Johnston\'s family following her death. From the archive: Cops apologize for deadly drug raid \'They blew it up, started over\' George Turner, who today is the APD police chief, headed up recruitment and training efforts at the time of Johnston\'s death. The Atlanta native, raised in a public housing project a few miles away from Johnston\'s house, was dismayed to watch the relationship between police and residents fray following the raid. "It was really an extreme black eye for our city," the 35-year APD veteran recalled. By 2008, FBI investigators had found that systemic problems that extended beyond three "rogue" officers. There was a widespread "culture of misconduct" that plagued much of the department, investigators said. It matters what police are thinking (Opinion) Then-APD Chief Richard Pennington would ultimately reassign his remaining narcotics officers, rebuilding the unit from scratch. He expanded the unit from eight members to 30 members. Each received rigorous training. The shake-up followed a pledge to review policies surrounding the use of informants and the use of "no-knock" warrants. "They did not take it lightly," Georgia State University criminal justice professor Dean Dabney said. "They blew it up, started over and put their best people in charge -- ethical leaders who cleaned up messes." In addition, Johnston\'s death prompted city officials to establish an independent board of citizens tasked with reviewing allegations of police misconduct. Lee Reid, the board\'s executive director, said the entity has both investigated complaints against officers and helped shape policies including body camera procedures. "If there\'s one good thing to come out of Kathryn Johnston\'s death, there\'s a greater commitment to holding APD and officials accountable," Reid said.

Some demonstrations nationwide have turned violent. JUST WATCHED Occupy Atlanta\'s non-violent protest Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nOccupy Atlanta\'s non-violent protest 02:30 Meanwhile, Atlanta Police endured more than three dozen officer-involved shootings between 2010 and 2015 -- yet largely averted contentious protests. According to Dabney, one reason for this is that local leaders proactively embraced reforms instead of resisting change after Johnston\'s death. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, who was elected three years after the botched drug raid, said APD has continued to move in the right direction after the swift action of former Mayor Shirley Franklin. Turner said APD has asked for far fewer "no-knock" warrants -- doing so only when absolutely necessary. In 2016, APD has executed less than 10 such warrants, according to Turner. (An APD spokesperson said the department does not have records of how many warrants it obtained in 2006.) JUST WATCHED Atlanta mayor: Let\'s support the police Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nAtlanta mayor: Let\'s support the police 01:19 Under Reed, APD has also sought to arrest repeat offenders -- individuals who have been arrested dozens of times but remain free -- to reduce crime throughout the city. In doing so, APD made 40 percent fewer narcotic arrests since 2010, a sign that there aren\'t alleged quotas today. But Turner said one of the biggest changes is a return to working with community residents instead of focusing on metrics. Earlier this year, APD installed surveillance cameras and license plate readers in some west Atlanta neighborhoods, including English Avenue, to boost security. Those upgrades have been coupled with an effort to subsidize housing costs for officers willing to live in distressed neighborhoods like English Avenue. "Instead of policing a community, we\'re talking about being a part of a community, policing our community," Turner said. In recent months, Turner said, upgrades have helped crime in the area drop by 20 percent -- a sign that APD is on the right track. "I don\'t think trust has been fully restored," Reed said. "It\'s far better than during the period where we lost Kathryn Johnston. It is improving." How should Kathryn Johnston be remembered? Last Sunday about a hundred churchgoers packed into the sanctuary of the Lindsay Street Baptist Church for a 10 a.m. service. As the children\'s choir crooned over the hum of a Hammond organ, the Rev. Anthony Motley welcomed everyone from affluent Buckhead businessmen to homeless women who attended to take part in Kathryn Johnston Day. Outside Motley\'s sanctuary, there\'s still much work to be done. To many Atlantans, the neighborhood still seems unsafe given the persistence of the drug market. Four blocks away, about a third of the houses on Johnston\'s block remain boarded up with plywood. Last month someone stole a mural that had hung over a window outside her vacant ranch. The mural that used to hang on Johnston\'s former home. Despite the perception, the neighborhood is doing better than it was a decade ago, Motley said. "[Johnston\'s death] caused the community to be humanized," Motley said. "The image of a drug-infested, prostitution-filled community suddenly, when the news got out, people said, \'grandmothers live here.\'" Not every reform has worked out as planned. State Sen. Vincent Fort, a Democrat from Atlanta who\'s running for mayor, said the citizen review board hasn\'t received sufficient staffing or funding to truly be effective. Last March, a review by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution found Chief Turner had only upheld 11 percent of the cases in which board members recommended disciplinary action for officers. Turner, who says oversight is "necessary," said board investigators don\'t always have as much information available about alleged incidents related to ongoing APD investigations. Because the board\'s findings are not binding, its members are ultimately hamstrung, Fort said. "It\'s a paper tiger," Fort said.

Last June, APD Officer James Burns fatally shot Devaris Caine Rogers, a 22-year-old unarmed black man who police say was driving away from the officer. JUST WATCHED Ex-cop charged with murder of unarmed black man Replay More Videos ...

Prosecutors have since charged the former APD officer with murder. Burns\' attorney recently told CNN that the officer\'s "reasonable belief is that this car was going to be used as a weapon against him." Burns is now awaiting trial. "Kathryn Johnston was an awakening," said Davis, who has since helped the Rogers family stage demonstrations. "APD has become more transparent and related better with the community on police misconduct cases." A decade later, Motley said Johnston\'s death remains a "textbook case of police brutality" even in the midst of all the officer-involved shootings that followed. It\'s a painful reminder of what the community has endured. The pastor wants to keep her legacy alive so history doesn\'t repeat itself. "We transformed her tragedy into positive action," Motley said. "A continual study of her tragedy will help redeem the rest of the nation."',

At times speaking in German, Spencer\'s 30-minute speech included the unmistakable marriage of Neo-Nazi hate and Trump\'s campaign slogan. Read More "It is only normal again when we are great again," Spencer said. A Trump transition spokesman released a short media statement Monday evening, but it took Trump until Tuesday to publicly disavow the group in his own words. And it came only when pressed in a meeting with New York Times reporters, editors and executives, " Of course I disavow and condemn them ," Trump said when asked about the group. But Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League, says Trump needed to do it sooner. "There seems to be a pattern in the Trump administration of waiting until the last moment. And we just don\'t have the luxury for that. When there are Nazi salutes in D.C., it\'s important to condemn it at the moment," Segal said. Segal referred to Trump\'s weekend tweets criticizing the cast of the Broadway show "Hamilton" when Vice President-elect Mike Pence attended. "If you have the time to tweet about the theater, you should have the time to tweet about a spate of hate crimes and Neo-Nazis in Washington D.C.," he said. Similar criticism was lobbed at Trump during the primaries when he hesitated before disavowing David Duke and the KKK on CNN\'s The Lead with Jake Tapper. "I know nothing about David Duke, I know nothing about white supremacy," Trump told Tapper. Republican National Committee RNC communications director Sean Spicer came to Trump\'s defense in an interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN\'s "The Situation Room." "When is it going to be enough?" Spicer said. He added, "He has said that he refutes that, that\'s not the kind of movement he wants the support or see energized by him. That\'s not the kind of people he wants to be associated with. I don\'t know how many more times Donald Trump can make his position clear, but he\'s been crystal-clear for a long time and over and over and over again with every tweet, utterance, you name it, Facebook post, he has to somehow respond to it. He has made his position clear. It\'s time that we accept that position and move on. That\'s not his focus." Criticism of Bannon The hiring of Steve Bannon as chief strategist in the Trump White House has only intensified the criticism of Trump on this issue. While Bannon once reportedly bragged to Mother Jones that his website, Breitbart.com, was the "platform for the alt-right," he later told the Wall Street Journal that he has "zero-tolerance: for those anti-Semitic tones. Trump said Tuesday that "Breitbart is just a publication. They\'re certainly much more conservative, but Breitbart is really a news organization that\'s become successful." Regarding Bannon, Trump said, "I\'ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If i thought he was a racist, or alt-right ... I wouldn\'t even think about hiring him." He later added: "I think it\'s very hard on him. I think he\'s having a hard time with it. Because it\'s not him." Former Breitbart spokesman Kurt Bardella told CNN the issue will continue to cause problems for Trump. "(Bannon) has said, Breitbart is the alt-right platform, these are the people that they have played to, that they have tried to motivate to be the base of Donald Trump\'s election. And it\'s just going to be more of this." Spencer threatens to spread his message Spencer\'s think tank used to be a small, obscure extremist group operating mostly on the Internet, but it\'s new confidence is apparent. Spencer even told The Washington Post that he has plans to give speeches at college campuses in hopes of gaining more supporters. But Spencer\'s message is white supremacism, anti-Semitic, anti-immigration and neo-Nazi. He\'s been banned from parts of Europe for trying to organize there. "America was until this past generation a white country, designed for ourselves and our posterity," Spencer told the crowd. "It is our creation, it is our inheritance and it belongs to us." Video of the event is so alarming, the national Holocaust museum in Washington wrote a letter in response, warning that "The Holocaust did not begin with killing, it began with words," and comparing Spencer\'s words to Hitler\'s. At the Times meeting, Trump said he wanted to look into the reason why Spencer\'s group feels so energized by his campaign. "It\'s not a group I want to energize, and if they are energized, I want to look into it and find out why," he said. During the primary season, a self-described "white advocate" explained it to CNN, saying Trump\'s anti-immigrant campaign promises were appealing to their message. "He is appealing to people who grew up in the United States and don\'t want to end their days in what turns out to be an outpost of Mexico or Vietnam or Guatemala or Haiti," Jared Taylor told CNN\'s Drew Griffin. The Southern Poverty Law Center put out a statement Tuesday saying it should be no surprise that Trump\'s campaign rhetoric has given people permission to say these things out loud. "The reason he\'s energized the alt-right is simple: He\'s been playing its tune from the day he announced his campaign and called Mexican immigrants rapists. His proposal to ban Muslim immigration, his talk of mass deportations, his attacks on \'political correctness,\' it\'s all been music to the ears of a movement that envisions a white America -- and that\'s exactly the America that the \'alt-right\' wants to see."

Find out what\'s happening in the world as it unfolds. JUST WATCHED Trump\'s son-in-law could take powerful White House role 03:02 Story highlights Ted Galen Carpenter: Nepotism is nothing new in the history of the US presidency Perhaps the toughest problem to address is the role of the presidential spouse, he says Ted Galen Carpenter is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and a contributing editor to The National Interest. He is the author of 10 books and the contributing editor of 10 books. The views expressed are his own. (CNN) The high-profile presence of Donald Trump\'s family in the transition team has drawn more than a few negative comments in the media. The President-elect\'s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, reportedly even played a key role in undermining the prospects of New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. The alleged motive, moreover, was Christie\'s earlier prosecution of Kushner\'s father for fraudulent dealings. Ted Galen Carpenter But the concern rose another notch when daughter Ivanka Trump (along with Kushner)reportedly attended a meeting between her father and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Such an incident did not seem to be just another clumsy manifestation of garden-variety nepotism, as bad as that aspect might be. Ivanka is poised to head the vast Trump business empire. Her participation in the meeting with the leader of one of America\'s most important trading and investment partners constituted a flagrant conflict of interest for the President-elect. Nepotism is nothing new in the history of the US presidency, although the Trump administration looks as though it may be especially susceptible. Perhaps the most blatant case was President John F. Kennedy\'s appointment of his brother Robert to the post of attorney general. That decision so rankled the political establishment that Congress eventually passed a statute that in the future barred members of the President\'s family from holding appointed posts in his or her administration. Kushner appears to be trying to find a way around that prohibition . Excluding relatives from official posts, though, hardly solves the nepotism problem; even when relatives do not occupy policymaking positions, they can still have a considerable impact on policy. Informal advisers can, and throughout America\'s history have, influenced occupants of the Oval Office. And those advisers often are friends or relatives. Perhaps the toughest problem to address is the role of the presidential spouse. The post of first lady (or first gentleman, in the event of a female president) is supposed to be primarily ceremonial or dealing with noncontroversial matters. That\'s an important point, because there is no provision for formal accountability, whether congressional oversight or some other mechanism, for policy initiatives undertaken by a person in that post. Yet some first ladies have exercised a substantial amount of influence over policy. Indeed, historians generally believe that Woodrow Wilson\'s wife, Edith, virtually ran the presidency for the final 18 months after his debilitating stroke in October 1919. Read More In our own era, first lady Hillary Clinton played extremely important roles in both her husband\'s domestic and foreign policy initiatives. She was so deeply involved in the design of the administration\'s (ultimately unsuccessful) health care plan that wags at one Washington think tank privately derided it as "HillBilly Health Care." Her greatest impact, though, may have come on policy in the Balkans -- in her discussions on Serbia with Bill Clinton, she later admitted, "I urged him to bomb." The alleged episode is described by Gail Sheehy in her book "Hillary\'s Choice ": "On March 21, 1999, Hillary expressed her views by phone to the President: \'I urged him to bomb.\' The Clintons argued the issue over the next few days. [The President expressed] what-ifs: What if bombing promoted more executions? What if it took apart the NATO alliance? Hillary responded: \'You cannot let this go on at the end of a century that has seen the major holocaust of our time. What do we have NATO for if not to defend our way of life?\' The next day the President declared that force was necessary." Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook If accurate, this would be a case of a presidential family member having not just some influence, but a decisive impact on policy. And such advice would have been offered without Clinton having had to undergo scrutiny from anyone else in a position of responsibility. Unfortunately, that type of influence is something that is extraordinarily difficult to guard against. There is no way to pass a law against presidential pillow talk, or one that bars the President from talking about a policy issue with his or her spouse or children over dinner. The reality is that nepotism is an ever-present temptation. One would hope that both the President-elect and his family members would exercise restraint. But that would require President-elect Trump to acknowledge that the American people have elected him, not his entire family. And it would require his children and in-laws to resist the enormous temptation that comes from intimate access to the presidency and its powers. History does not provide much confidence, though, that either the President or his family will resist the lure of nepotism. And so far, the Trump family\'s conduct during the transition process inspires even less confidence.',

Some are in jobs that come with housing or other perks that allow employers to pay less than the minimum wage. Others are being cheated by their employer. \nRelated: Brexit slashes U.K. household wealth by $1.5 trillion \nThe U.K.\'s minimum wage was last raised in April, when it increased from £6.70 ($8.30) to £7.20 ($8.90). \nThe government previously set itself the goal of hiking the minimum wage to £9 ($11.20) by 2020 -- but only if the economy continues to generate sustained growth. \nBusinesses, meanwhile, have warned about the impact of a higher minimum wage. \nMarcus Mason, head of business at British Chambers of Commerce, said that an increase to £9 would force many firms to raise prices and cut staff. \n"The government needs to take into consideration the current economic climate and level of uncertainty and burden facing U.K. businesses right now," he said. \nThe U.S. federal minimum wage is $7.25. But nine states and the District of Columbia have a minimum wage of at least $9.25, according to the Economic Policy Institute. CNNMoney (London)   22, 2016: 8:23 PM ET',

This is a transcript of the speech she gave after accepting the honor Tuesday night in New York. \nNew York (CNN) I never in a million years thought I would be up here on stage appealing for the freedom and safety of American journalists at home.\nLadies and gentlemen, I added the bits from candidate Trump as a reminder of the peril we face. I actually hoped that once President-elect, all that that would change, and I still do. But I was chilled when the first tweet after the election was about "professional protesters incited by the media." Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 He walked back the part about the protesters but not the part about the media. We\'re not there. But postcard from the world: This is how it goes with authoritarians like Sisi, Erdoğan, Putin, the Ayatollahs, Duterte, et al. As all the international journalists we honor in this room tonight and every year know only too well: First the media is accused of inciting, then sympathizing, then associating -- until they suddenly find themselves accused of being full-fledged terrorists and subversives. Then they end up in handcuffs, in cages, in kangaroo courts, in prison -- and then who knows? Read More Just to say, Erdoğan has just told my Israeli colleague Ilana Dayan that he cannot understand why anyone\'s protesting in America , it must mean they don\'t accept -- or understand -- democracy! And he thinks America like all great countries needs a strongman to get things done! \'An appeal to protect journalism\' A great America requires a great and free and safe press. So this above all is an appeal to protect journalism itself. Recommit to robust fact-based reporting without fear nor favor -- on the issues. Don\'t stand for being labeled crooked or lying or failing. Do stand up together -- for divided we will all fall. JUST WATCHED How could President Trump limit press freedom? Replay More Videos ...

It appeared much of the media got itself into knots trying to differentiate between balance, objectivity, neutrality, and crucially, truth. We cannot continue the old paradigm -- let\'s say like over global warming -- where 99.9% of the empirical scientific evidence is given equal play with the tiny minority of deniers. I learned long ago, covering the ethnic cleansing and genocide in Bosnia , never to equate victim with aggressor, never to create a false moral or factual equivalence, because then you are an accomplice to the most unspeakable crimes and consequences. \'Stop banalizing the truth\' I believe in being truthful, not neutral. And I believe we must stop banalizing the truth. And we have to be prepared to fight especially hard for the truth in a world where the Oxford English Dictionary just announced its word of 2016: "post-truth." We have to accept that we\'ve had our lunch handed to us by the very same social media that we\'ve so slavishly been devoted to. The winning candidate did a savvy end run around us and used it to go straight to the people.

Are journalists facing an \'existential crisis?\' Wael Ghonim, one of the fathers of the Arab spring, dubbed the social media revolution, now says: "The same medium that so effectively transmits a howling message of change also appears to undermine the ability to make it. Social media amplifies the human tendency to bind with one\'s own kind. It tends to reduce complex social challenges to mobilizing slogans that reverberate in echo chambers of the like-minded rather than engage in persuasion, dialogue, and the reach for consensus. Hate speech and untruths appear alongside good intentions and truths." I feel that we face an existential crisis, a threat to the very relevance and usefulness of our profession.

A quick anecdote from out there: In the 1997 Iranian elections, the reform candidate won and the establishment ayatollahs were caught totally off guard. One of them asked me later how I was so sure and when did I know that Khatami was going to win. I told him, as soon as I got on the ground and started talking to people! Just saying. Fighting against a \'post-values world\' We must also fight against a post-values world. And let me hit back at this elitist backlash we\'re all bending over backwards to accommodate. Since when were American values elitist values? They are not left or right values. They are not rich or poor values, not the forgotten-man values. Like many foreigners I have learned they are universal. They are the values of every American from the humblest to the most exalted. They form the very fundamental foundation of the United States and are the basis of America\'s global leadership. They are brand America. They are America\'s greatest export and gift to the world.

Hide Caption 30 of 30 So yes, like so many around the world, I was shocked -- very few ever imagined that so many Americans conducting their sacred duty in the sanctity of the voting booth, with their secret ballot, would be angry enough to ignore the wholesale vulgarity of language, the sexual predatory behavior, the deep misogyny, the bigoted and insulting views. Gov. Mario Cuomo said you campaign in poetry and govern in prose. Perhaps the opposite will be true this time around. If not, I will fight as a journalist -- as we all must -- to defend and protect the unique value system that makes these United States -- and with which it seeks to influence the world. \'We must fight against normalization of the unacceptable\' The conservative radio host who may be the next white house press secretary says mainstream media is hostile to traditional values. I would say it\'s just the opposite. And have you read about the "heil, victory" meeting in Washington , DC this past weekend? Why aren\'t there more stories about the dangerous rise of the far right here and in Europe? Since when did anti-Semitism stop being a litmus test in this country? JUST WATCHED World remembers Jo Cox Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nWorld remembers Jo Cox 01:56 We must fight against normalization of the unacceptable. A week before the heated Brexit referendum in the UK, the gorgeous, young, optimistic, idealistic, compassionate MP Jo Cox, a remainer, was shot and stabbed to death by a maniac yelling "Britain first." She was particularly sensitive to the plight of Syrian war refugees. At his trial, the court was told the accused had researched information on the SS and the KKK. JUST WATCHED Husband of slain MP Jo Cox on continuing her fight Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH \nHusband of slain MP Jo Cox on continuing her fight 08:58 Just a few weeks ago, her husband, Brendan, now raising their two tiny toddlers, expanded for me on an op-ed he\'d written: "Political leaders and people generally must embrace the responsibility to speak out against bigotry. Unless the center holds against the insidious creep of extremism, history shows how quickly hatred is normalized. What begins with biting your tongue for political expediency, or out of social awkwardness, soon becomes complicity with something far worse. Before you know it, it\'s already too late." So now the solutions!! The media\'s role in the world Somehow, the war of attrition in this country has to end. You\'ve all seen the results of this election. It\'s very close. The nation is very divided, and angry. Are we in the media going to keep whipping up that war -- or are we going to take a deep breath and maybe have a reset?! It matters to us out there abroad too. For better or for worse, this is the world\'s only superpower. Culturally too. The political example, the media example set here, are quickly emulated and rolled out across the world. We, the media, can either contribute to a more functional system or to deepening the political dysfunction. Which world do we want to leave our children? In the same way, politics has been driven into poisonous partisan and paralyzing corners, where political differences are criminalized, where the zero sum game means in order for me to win, you have to be destroyed. What happened to compromise and common ground? That same dynamic has infected powerful segments of the American media. Like it has in Egypt and Turkey and Russia, where journalists have been pushed into political partisan corners as we see here tonight -- delegitimized, accused of being enemies of the state. Stop journalism from becoming \'weaponized\' Journalism itself has become weaponized. We have to stop it. We all have a huge amount of work to do, investigating wrongdoing, holding power accountable, enabling decent government, defending basic rights, actually covering the world -- Russia, Syria, North Korean nukes. Can\'t we have differences without killing each other off? As a profession, let\'s fight for what is right. Let\'s fight for our values Bad things do happen when good people do nothing. How to talk politics at your Thanksgiving meal this year In the words of the great civil rights leader, congressman John Lewis: "Young people and people not so young have a moral obligation and a mission and a mandate to get in good trouble." So let\'s go out and make some. And especially -- let\'s fight to remain relevant and useful. Perhaps contemplating the long weekend ahead, let\'s resolve not to be turkeys voting for thanksgiving! Happy holidays, everyone.',

That figure is on par with Ronald Reagan\'s approval rating shortly after the presidential election in 1988, and approaching the level reached by Bill Clinton in November 2000. Obama far outpaces George W. Bush\'s approval rating in November 2008, when just 24% approved of the outgoing president. Improvements in Obama\'s approval rating seem to stem largely from Republicans and Republican-leaning independents. Among that group of leaned Republicans, 22% now approve of Obama\'s job performance, up from 16% in late October. Among Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents, it has held steady at 91%. Read the results The president\'s favorability rating is also at its highest point since fall of 2009, with 59% saying they have a positive impression of Obama and 38% seeing him unfavorably. But the warm ratings for Obama do not extend to his party. Favorability ratings for the Democratic Party dropped 6 points since October, and the 54% who hold an unfavorable opinion of it is the highest in CNN/ORC or CNN/USA Today/Gallup polling dating back to 1992. Read More Among Democrats, favorability ratings for the party have dipped to 81%, down 10 points since late October. That\'s the lowest mark Democrats have given their own party in CNN polling in more than a decade. Just 28% of independents have a favorable take on the Democratic Party, an 11-point drop since October. The Republican Party, meanwhile, has seen its stock rise somewhat in this poll compared with its ratings during a heated presidential campaign. Overall, 41% hold a favorable opinion of the GOP and 52% an unfavorable one. That\'s a 5-point uptick in favorable views, and the highest mark for the GOP since last summer. With majorities saying they have unfavorable views of each party, there\'s a large amount of overlap in those groups: Nearly a quarter of Americans say they have unfavorable views of both the Democratic and the Republican parties (23% say so). There is not as much overlap, however, between those who think the current president is doing a good job and those who expect the next one to do well. Overall, just 15% of Americans say both that they approve of Obama\'s performance in office and that Trump will do a good job as president once he assumes the office. More say they approve of Obama and expect Trump to do poorly (41%) or that they think Trump will be a good president but disapprove of Obama (37%). A scant 3% disapprove of Obama and think Trump will be a bad president. The poll also finds Obama is seen as having a range of positive traits that fewer perceive in his successor. About 6 in 10 consider the president a person they admire; just 33% say the same about Trump. Sixty-two percent consider Obama to be honest and trustworthy vs. 41% who say so about Trump. And Obama tops Trump by 17 points on empathy, with 63% saying the president cares about "people like you" vs. 46% who feel the president-elect does. Obama also outpaces Trump by 7 points on managing the government effectively -- 57% say Obama has, 50% predict that Trump will. But Trump has the edge on what some consider Obama\'s signature message: Change. While 49% think Trump can bring the kind of change the country needs, 45% say Obama did that during his time in office, with 54% saying that he has not accomplished that goal. The two are near-even on uniting the country, with 46% saying Obama has united the country and not divided it, and 43% saying they think Trump will. The CNN/ORC poll was conducted by telephone from Nov. 17 through 20 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.',

Neither Moscow nor Washington needs tension in the Middle East or Europe to boil over, and neither directly threatens the other, so there is a deal to be made.

If the deal to lift sanctions in return for cutting Tehran\'s nukes works, keep it. If not, talk to them about a new deal. Europe? The same.

What about Libya, which President Barack Obama has declared the greatest foreign policy mistake in his eight years in the White House? Follow CNN Opinion \nJoin us on Twitter and Facebook Mahmoud Jibril, former Prime Minister of the rebel administration that emerged in Libya\'s Arab Spring to combat Moammar Gadhafi, said the key to Libya, as with Syria, is learning to work with Russia: "If Trump can reach some sort of rapprochement with Russia, then there is a likelihood some sort of transaction over various MENA (Middle East and North Africa) problems can be reached." And it will be reached with the blunt mind of a businessman. The United States has been backing Libya\'s unelected, unpopular Government of National Accord, which has failed to become either a government, or find accord in a country convulsed in violence. A Trump view may be that, if it cannot command the respect of Libyans or bring peace, what is America doing supporting it? Why not find other groups to knit together a peace that would leave one less global headache for the United States to worry about. Trump\'s dealmaking, echoing that of Kissinger, can personify a spirit of realpolitik in the 21st century, using politically unorthodox skills that get the job done.',

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. \n(CNN) By taking the trouble of organizing a motorcade to make the 1.4 mile-trip from his Manhattan home to the headquarters of The New York Times, President-elect Donald Trump made a telling break with the choreography of the transition. The Times, arguably the world\'s most powerful news organization, is an institution to which even an American president must pay a degree of respect. \nUp to now, Trump, ever the showman, has created a spectacle by making followers, advisers job-seekers and other supplicants travel to Trump Tower or to Trump\'s golf club in New Jersey to talk about the administration he is forming.

But the real challenge for Trump will be the less formal check provided by a free and independent press.

  text: 'Top journalists warn of threat to press freedom \'quite close to home\' by Brian Stelter @brianstelter November 22, 2016: 8:49 PM ET How could President Trump limit press freedom? Some of the country\'s top journalists issued stark warnings about the importance of protecting First Amendment rights on Tuesday night, two weeks after Donald Trump was elected president. \n"This year the threats to press freedom are quite close to home. It\'s right here," New Yorker editor David Remnick said at the Committee to Protect Journalists dinner in New York City. \n"We will hold the new administration\'s feet to the fire. And they should respect that, even if they don\'t welcome it," CNN President Jeff Zucker said. \nTrump\'s attacks against the American media were a recurring theme during the annual dinner, which focuses on threats to journalists in repressive regimes. \nSandra Mims Rowe, the chairman of the committee, said erosion in media rights in the United States "would further imperil journalists everywhere." \n"The United States simply cannot provide ammunition to anyone whose goal it is to silence a critical press," she said. \nZucker, the chairman of this year\'s dinner, spoke in detail about the president-elect one day after attending an off the record meeting at Trump Tower. \nAnchors and executives from five major networks met with Trump and several of the president-elect\'s top advisers. \n"I want to use this occasion to reiterate what I said directly to the president elect yesterday," Zucker said. "As the new leader of the free world, we expect that he will preserve longstanding traditions that ensure coverage of his presidency." \nZucker specifically cited the importance of the "press pool," a small group of journalists who travel with the president and report on his actions. \n"The role of the press is vital to our democracy," he said. "This is not about access for the press itself. It is about access for all Americans." \nRelated: Politico editor resigns after publishing addresses of extremist leader \nIn the two weeks since his election, Trump has repeatedly traveled without the pool. Trump aides have said they will implement a pool soon, but have not provided specifics. \nZucker said "it is still too early to draw conclusions about how this administration will work with the media, "But "I think it is fair to say that based on some of what we saw during the campaign, we have some reason for concern." \n"That sentiment was expressed yesterday to the president-elect from those of us who met with him," he added. "We take our roles very seriously." \nRemnick began the dinner by paying tribute to Gwen Ifill, the PBS anchor who died last week. Alluding to the incoming administration and the widespread concerns about press freedom, he said she died "when we need her the most." \nChanneling Ifill, Remnick said journalists should "report into the teeth of the current atmosphere" and act "fearlessly." \nZucker also spoke about Ifill\'s impact and congratulated CNN\'s Christiane Amanpour, who is receiving an award from the committee on Tuesday night. \n"We are fortunate to live in a nation where tenacious journalists like Christiane and Gwen can challenge authority without fear of reprisal," he said. "We must collectively ensure that this remains the case here at home, while we continue to fight for these values around the world."

  text: 'Story highlights New York to protect Thanksgiving Day Parade with an eye toward Nice truck attack There has been no specific threat, but an ISIS magazine suggests the parade would be a good target (CNN) The New York Police Department on Tuesday outlined increased security precautions for the Thanksgiving Day Parade, a week after an ISIS magazine said the parade would make a good target, and a day after a man was arrested in Brooklyn and accused of expressing support for an attack in Times Square.\nThe NYPD said for this year\'s parade, one new step will be to place heavy sand trucks at cross streets along the parade route to protect from the kind of deadly truck attack that took place in Nice, France, in July . The weight of the vehicles is intended to block that type of attack, where an attacker driving a truck through a crowd celebrating Bastille Day killed 86 pedestrians. "The Nice attack was an indicator of something we had to make adjustments because of," said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio. "That\'s why the sand trucks are there. And you will not see vehicles crossing the route of the parade." To prevent a truck from being rented and used as a weapon, the police department says it has visited 135 truck rental locations to encourage vigilance when it comes to renting trucks to anyone exhibiting suspicious behavior. The ISIS magazine Rumiyah last week described how effective a vehicle attack could be in inflicting high casualties. It cited the Nice attack as a model, and encouraged militant followers to rent a heavy truck and target any large outdoor gathering, "to ensure utmost carnage up on the enemies of Allah." Under a photo of the Thanksgiving Day Parade in New York, the caption said, "An excellent target." Read More Security officials in New York rejected that description. "Actually it\'s not an excellent target. It\'s a very well protected event," Deputy Commissioner of Intelligence and Counterterrorism John Miller said Friday. Miller said that in years past authorities have used "blocker cars" to prevent the possibility of unauthorized vehicles entering the parade route. This year, large trucks filled with sand will be used instead of cars to block off streets intersecting the parade route. "That gives us an advantage in several ways: A sand truck is longer than a blocker car, so we can use fewer of them and cover more ground; and secondly, you\'re not going to move (a truck) if you hit it with something," Miller said. Law enforcement officials said they have no specific, credible threats to the parade. But Miller said the city was preparing for it as it has for other high-profile events: bringing in counterterrorism officers, plainclothes officers, search dogs and even radiation detectors. He said the police department saw the Rumiyah threat not only as an attackers\' handbook, but also as a fear tactic. "What you see is the psychological warfare of printing materials," Miller said. "We never accede to that. On the other hand, we have seen instances where Islamic State has put out the call, and people have risen to that call, which is why we have one of the most robust, complicated counterterrorism programs in the world." Truck mentioned by Brooklyn suspect, police say A terrorism arrest in Brooklyn on Monday, while unrelated, highlights the concerns that a radicalized individual could target an everyday high-profile location. Federal prosecutors accuse 37-year-old Mohamed Naji of trying to provide material support to ISIS. According to a criminal complaint, Naji expressed support for ISIS, and expressed support for staging an attack in Times Square similar to the truck attack in Nice. He allegedly told a confidential informant, "Islamic State ... they want an operation in Times Square. ... If there is a truck, I mean a garbage truck, and one drives it there to Times Square and crushes them. ..." Law enforcement officials said they do not believe Naji had any specific plot in the works. According to his lawyer, Susan Kellman, "He absolutely denies the allegations in the complaint." Travel alert issued for Americans in Europe But experts warn of an ever-present threat from lone-wolf attackers. "It\'s not the one-off. It\'s whether you miss any of them over the course of years," said former CIA counterterrorism official Philip Mudd. "When they radicalize 100 people, 1,000 people, 5,000 people, who never even have to travel to Syria, if you misfire with those guys, you have a problem." Americans are also being warned about terror threats abroad when traveling during the holidays. The State Department has issued a travel alert, warning Americans to exercise caution at holiday festivals, events, and outdoor markets in Europe in the coming weeks. While there is no specific threat, the bulletin says, "extremist sympathizers or self-radicalized extremists may conduct attacks during this period with little or no warning." The alert highlights how difficult it is to secure so many public places against a potential attack. "People are going through areas that we just can\'t fully secure," said David Inserra, who studies homeland security at The Heritage Foundation. "We can\'t make sure that every single bus station, every single train station is fully secure."',

  text: 'Story highlights To be better about gratefulness, find easy ways to count blessings more often There are a number of mental and physical health benefits correlated with being a thankful person This essay is part of a column called The Wisdom Project by David Allan, editorial director of CNN Health and Wellness. The series is on applying to one\'s life the wisdom and philosophy found everywhere, from ancient texts to pop culture. You can follow David at @davidgallan . Don\'t miss another Wisdom Project column; subscribe here . \n(CNN) Logically speaking, we should be in a perpetual state of gratitude. Most people who read this column, even if they aren\'t fully aware, have a long list of blessings to count (most of the time, anyway). \nFamily. Friends. Love. Health. Freedom from war and natural disaster. Imagination. Community. A roof over our heads. Common decency. Hope. Opportunity. Memories. Financial stability. Favorite places. Days off work. Good weather. The golden age of television. Books. Music. Ice cream. Weekends. A friendly exchange. Something good that happened today. Something bad that didn\'t happen today. A good cup of coffee. You may not have everything you want or even need, but that probably leaves buckets -- nay, container ships -- full of tangible and conceptual items for which to be grateful. Things can always be better, but they can always be worse. It often depends on how you look at that proverbial glass of water. To get in better touch with gratefulness, all you have to do is find easy ways to count blessings more often than, say, over an annual turkey dinner. Keep them boiling on the front burner of your mind, and you increase your appreciation of life. What keeps us from longer and more frequent visits to a grateful (and graceful) mental place is that we think about other things. In fact, we are wired to. Our primitive brains smartly evolved the capacity to quickly sense potential threats, to keep us safe. But in a post-saber-toothed-tiger era, we get easily annoyed, worried and distracted by a lot of extraneous noise. Read More \'It\'s a Wonderful Life" has a wonderful lesson Instead, we need more focus on the positive, And you don\'t have to set the bar high. Allow yourself to be thankful for the small, mundane things that give you joy and meaning, as well as the big ones. And don\'t try to gather heaps of blessings to count; a handful each day should do it. In his play "Two Trains Running," August Wilson wrote, "You walking around here with a ten-gallon bucket. Somebody put a little cupful in and you get mad \'cause it\'s empty. You can\'t go through life carrying a ten-gallon bucket. Get you a little cup. That\'s all you need. Get you a little cup and somebody put a bit in and it\'s half-full." Here are some low-threshold habits and traditions to institute that will fill that little cup right up. And a number of reasons you should bother to do so. Thanks to be healthy The most obvious reason to boost your gratitude is that it\'s closely tied to increased feelings of happiness. The studies backing that up are not surprising. What\'s remarkable is that scientists who have located thoughts of gratitude in the brain found that not only do they produce feelings of pleasure, they stimulate areas regulating stress . This makes intuitive sense. Be more aware of what you feel is good in your life, and you will feel good. Also, if you\'re sufficiently grateful, you\'re less likely to compare yourself to others, which is often the enemy of happiness. How to stop being annoyed by life Resilience, including the ability to cope with stress and trauma, is another trait correlated with gratitude. Studies have showed that counting blessings was a factor in managing post-traumatic stress for Vietnam War veterans and an effective coping strategy for many after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Other research shows that the more grateful you are, the more you are likely to exhibit patience and self-control . It can even be good for marriages and relationships: Couples good at exhibiting thankfulness tend to be "more committed and more likely to remain in their relationships over time." Our best selves, it seems, are our most grateful selves. Studies have showed that gratitude can indirectly influence physical health, as well. Those who have "dispositional gratitude" -- defined by one study as "part of a wider life orientation towards noticing and appreciating the positive in the world" -- are more likely to report good physical health , a propensity for healthy activities and willingness to seek help for health concerns. In another study, New York teenagers who rated as the most grateful in their class -- defined by "having a disposition and moods that enabled them to respond positively to the good people and things in their lives" -- were less likely to abuse drugs and alcohol . The benefits of having more gratitude also correlated with benefits to the heart among patients who had experienced heart failure. Being grateful can even get you a better night\'s sleep. According to one study involving college students who instituted various methods for increasing gratitude, such as a gratitude journal, they worried less at bedtime and slept longer and better . In another study, adults in the UK (40% of whom had sleep disorders), reported that thinking about what they are grateful for at night led to falling asleep faster and staying asleep longer. Convinced? Let\'s get to the fun part. How to up your GQ (gratefulness quotient) I\'m currently conducting two completely unscientific thankfullness-boosting experiments. For nearly two years, I\'ve been keeping a gratitude journal. And for the last five years or so, my family has engaged in a dinnertime ritual called "Roses, Thorns & Buds" that surfaces the same details. A lot has been written about these and other thankfulness experiments, and it should be noted that there are no rules or even standards that govern them. We\'re in very, very soft science territory here. But reliable research does show that whatever you do to increase gratitude pays off, so it\'s worth it to find what is easy, enjoyable and effective for you. Drawing upon your own life experiments A gratitude journal need not be any more complicated than keeping a notebook by your bed and starting a nightly habit of jotting down who and what you were grateful for that day. Journaling was the standard method for some of the studies cited above, so this is a simple but effective option. I\'m coming up on two years of trying this one, and I added a layer you may want to consider. After one year, I took the time to total up all the mentions. My wife and children were, predictably, at the top, reminding me not to take them for granted. But I was surprised to see that co-workers, neighbors and a city park all ranked highly. It was useful for me to review in that way, because when I see those people, I have this added layer of positive feeling about them at the forefront of my mind. It\'s hard to get annoyed by someone when you think, "I\'m so often grateful for that person." It was fun to play with the data, too. By category, "family" was the clear winner (1,011 instances) for me, followed by "places" (269 instances, with coffee shops being the biggest sub-category), "friends" (259), CNN "co-workers" (197) and "experiences" (133). Also, "Star Wars" (11) beat both beer (10) and books (8). It will be interesting to compare second-year totals against these. All of it is getting me closer to understanding and remembering what I\'m most grateful for. Good and bad is the same: a Taoist parable Roses, Thorns & Buds (or RTB, among its devotees) has been part of so many family dinners since my older daughter was 4 years old that I\'ve forgotten where we first heard about it. It\'s quite simple: Everyone at the table takes turns sharing "roses," which are something positive and happy-making about their day; "thorns," which are the opposite of that; and "buds" for something we\'re looking forward to and we anticipate will be a rose. Sometimes, the family meal and sharing these things itself is a rose. Granted, the "thorn" doesn\'t necessarily increase gratitude -- though it\'s still useful from a family discussion, empathy and problem-solving perspective. And if you can fix a problem, a rose may grow in that thorn\'s place. Here are our unscientific findings: Each time, we find that we have many roses and buds and usually only one thorn to share. Friends have told us about effective variations on this technique, so one size doesn\'t fit all. If the metaphor is too flowery for you, pick another. Home runs, strikeouts and on deck? The important thing is to connect to the thankfulness in this way, whether you do it most evenings or on the occasional weekend. It\'s also an easy way for kids to get into a thankfulness habit themselves. Happiness jars , a strategy popularized by "Eat, Pray, Love" author Elizabeth Gilbert, is something of a hybrid of gratitude journal and RTB. The idea is to write down on a slip of paper the happiest moment of the day and drop it in a jar. The advantage of doing it this way is that in moments of unhappiness, you can reach into the jar and be reminded of those moments, perhaps becoming grateful for them anew. Gilbert was struck by how many of her fans shared photos of their decorated happiness jars ( see Pinterest if you need inspiration ) and by how her happiest moments are " generally really common and quiet and unremarkable ." And there are other experiments to try. You could set alarms/reminders on your phone to pause and think of something you are grateful for at different times of the day: Mornings help set the tone of the day, and reflecting while at work can be particularly useful. You can then record them on a gratitude journaling app. Subscribe to this column Don\'t miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here .\nOr you could just focus on the simple act of saying thank you, and meaning it, more frequently. Writing letters of thanks (or emails if you want to be faster and more frequent) to those for whom you are grateful is worth doing with some regularity. You can also express gratitude with gifts, flowers and favors. Or simply make of list of all the things we take for granted but would be so unhappy to lose, such as job security, health, seeing loved ones. Review that list every week or so. Whatever way you start infusing your life with more moments of gratitude, in the short and long term, you will be grateful that you did.',

Allow yourself to be thankful for the small, mundane things that give you joy and meaning, as well as the big ones. And don\'t try to gather heaps of blessings to count; a handful each day should do it. In his play "Two Trains Running," August Wilson wrote, "You walking around here with a ten-gallon bucket. Somebody put a little cupful in and you get mad \'cause it\'s empty. You can\'t go through life carrying a ten-gallon bucket. Get you a little cup. That\'s all you need. Get you a little cup and somebody put a bit in and it\'s half-full." Here are some low-threshold habits and traditions to institute that will fill that little cup right up. And a number of reasons you should bother to do so. Thanks to be healthy The most obvious reason to boost your gratitude is that it\'s closely tied to increased feelings of happiness. The studies backing that up are not surprising. What\'s remarkable is that scientists who have located thoughts of gratitude in the brain found that not only do they produce feelings of pleasure, they stimulate areas regulating stress . This makes intuitive sense. Be more aware of what you feel is good in your life, and you will feel good. Also, if you\'re sufficiently grateful, you\'re less likely to compare yourself to others, which is often the enemy of happiness. How to stop being annoyed by life Resilience, including the ability to cope with stress and trauma, is another trait correlated with gratitude. Studies have showed that counting blessings was a factor in managing post-traumatic stress for Vietnam War veterans and an effective coping strategy for many after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Other research shows that the more grateful you are, the more you are likely to exhibit patience and self-control . It can even be good for marriages and relationships: Couples good at exhibiting thankfulness tend to be "more committed and more likely to remain in their relationships over time." Our best selves, it seems, are our most grateful selves. Studies have showed that gratitude can indirectly influence physical health, as well. Those who have "dispositional gratitude" -- defined by one study as "part of a wider life orientation towards noticing and appreciating the positive in the world" -- are more likely to report good physical health , a propensity for healthy activities and willingness to seek help for health concerns. In another study, New York teenagers who rated as the most grateful in their class -- defined by "having a disposition and moods that enabled them to respond positively to the good people and things in their lives" -- were less likely to abuse drugs and alcohol . The benefits of having more gratitude also correlated with benefits to the heart among patients who had experienced heart failure. Being grateful can even get you a better night\'s sleep. According to one study involving college students who instituted various methods for increasing gratitude, such as a gratitude journal, they worried less at bedtime and slept longer and better . In another study, adults in the UK (40% of whom had sleep disorders), reported that thinking about what they are grateful for at night led to falling asleep faster and staying asleep longer. Convinced? Let\'s get to the fun part. How to up your GQ (gratefulness quotient) I\'m currently conducting two completely unscientific thankfullness-boosting experiments. For nearly two years, I\'ve been keeping a gratitude journal. And for the last five years or so, my family has engaged in a dinnertime ritual called "Roses, Thorns & Buds" that surfaces the same details. A lot has been written about these and other thankfulness experiments, and it should be noted that there are no rules or even standards that govern them. We\'re in very, very soft science territory here. But reliable research does show that whatever you do to increase gratitude pays off, so it\'s worth it to find what is easy, enjoyable and effective for you. Drawing upon your own life experiments A gratitude journal need not be any more complicated than keeping a notebook by your bed and starting a nightly habit of jotting down who and what you were grateful for that day. Journaling was the standard method for some of the studies cited above, so this is a simple but effective option. I\'m coming up on two years of trying this one, and I added a layer you may want to consider. After one year, I took the time to total up all the mentions. My wife and children were, predictably, at the top, reminding me not to take them for granted. But I was surprised to see that co-workers, neighbors and a city park all ranked highly. It was useful for me to review in that way, because when I see those people, I have this added layer of positive feeling about them at the forefront of my mind. It\'s hard to get annoyed by someone when you think, "I\'m so often grateful for that person." It was fun to play with the data, too. By category, "family" was the clear winner (1,011 instances) for me, followed by "places" (269 instances, with coffee shops being the biggest sub-category), "friends" (259), CNN "co-workers" (197) and "experiences" (133). Also, "Star Wars" (11) beat both beer (10) and books (8). It will be interesting to compare second-year totals against these. All of it is getting me closer to understanding and remembering what I\'m most grateful for. Good and bad is the same: a Taoist parable Roses, Thorns & Buds (or RTB, among its devotees) has been part of so many family dinners since my older daughter was 4 years old that I\'ve forgotten where we first heard about it. It\'s quite simple: Everyone at the table takes turns sharing "roses," which are something positive and happy-making about their day; "thorns," which are the opposite of that; and "buds" for something we\'re looking forward to and we anticipate will be a rose. Sometimes, the family meal and sharing these things itself is a rose. Granted, the "thorn" doesn\'t necessarily increase gratitude -- though it\'s still useful from a family discussion, empathy and problem-solving perspective. And if you can fix a problem, a rose may grow in that thorn\'s place. Here are our unscientific findings: Each time, we find that we have many roses and buds and usually only one thorn to share. Friends have told us about effective variations on this technique, so one size doesn\'t fit all. If the metaphor is too flowery for you, pick another. Home runs, strikeouts and on deck? The important thing is to connect to the thankfulness in this way, whether you do it most evenings or on the occasional weekend. It\'s also an easy way for kids to get into a thankfulness habit themselves. Happiness jars , a strategy popularized by "Eat, Pray, Love" author Elizabeth Gilbert, is something of a hybrid of gratitude journal and RTB. The idea is to write down on a slip of paper the happiest moment of the day and drop it in a jar. The advantage of doing it this way is that in moments of unhappiness, you can reach into the jar and be reminded of those moments, perhaps becoming grateful for them anew. Gilbert was struck by how many of her fans shared photos of their decorated happiness jars ( see Pinterest if you need inspiration ) and by how her happiest moments are " generally really common and quiet and unremarkable ." And there are other experiments to try. You could set alarms/reminders on your phone to pause and think of something you are grateful for at different times of the day: Mornings help set the tone of the day, and reflecting while at work can be particularly useful. You can then record them on a gratitude journaling app. Subscribe to this column \nDon\'t miss another Wisdom Project column by subscribing here . Or you could just focus on the simple act of saying thank you, and meaning it, more frequently. Writing letters of thanks (or emails if you want to be faster and more frequent) to those for whom you are grateful is worth doing with some regularity. You can also express gratitude with gifts, flowers and favors. Or simply make of list of all the things we take for granted but would be so unhappy to lose, such as job security, health, seeing loved ones. Review that list every week or so. Whatever way you start infusing your life with more moments of gratitude, in the short and long term, you will be grateful that you did.',

  text: 'Black Friday\'s dirty secrets: How to shop through the clutter by Samantha Murphy Kelly @HeySamantha November 23, 2016: 9:00 AM ET Watch this shopping technology track your every move There\'s no shortage of tech deals to choose from this holiday season. The hard part is figuring out what to buy. \nJust looking at the specs -- 4K UHD TVs, 1080p displays, quad-core processors -- is enough to give you a holiday hangover. \nConsidering the sheer number of items on sale starting this week -- Walmart alone has 11 TV deals -- you\'ll want to be an informed shopper. \nAccording to the Consumer Electronics Association, TVs and laptops top the list of what shoppers will look for this holiday season, followed by smartphones, video games, tablets and headphones. \nTo make it easier, we\'ve rounded up what you should keep in mind -- and other tips, like where to buy the cheapest Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) products -- before reaching for your wallet. \nTVs \nAbout 98% of U.S. households own a TV -- and the average house has three. When you\'re shopping for a new one, first consider where it will go and why you want it. Will it be your flagship set in the living room, or is it destined for the guest bedroom or kitchen? \nThe living room : If you want all the new bells and whistles, consider a 4K display, also known as Ultra HD. This means the resolution -- 3,840 by 2,160 pixels -- is four times that of an HDTV. You\'ll get a super crisp picture and be ahead of the trend. \n"We\'re excited 4K TVs will finally see significant discounts, but shoppers should know that options for 4K content are still limited," said Benjamin Glaser, editor at DealNews. Samsung\'s S5\' 6500 series TV, a curved 4K Ultra HD smart LED model, is on sale for $697 at Walmart. \nYou\'ll still be able to watch TV on a stunning display, but most entertainment companies aren\'t yet producing content specific for a 4K TV\'s resolution. \nBeyond display, keep these specs on your radar: Smart capability -- so you can stream content from the web -- and HDMI ports, if you\'re planning to connect other devices to it. The price points will be dictated by these features, as well as screen size. \nYour second TV : You can still find solid 4K options for less money. Walmart is offering a 43-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart TV for $199. Standard HDTVs are very affordable this season, too. Smaller HDTVs (32 inches) can get you even closer to $100. \nLaptops \nYou may know off the bat whether you want a Windows, Mac or Google Chrome operating system, but the options within any of those are vast. The three things you need to decide on are screen size, hard drive space and computer processing capability. \nSize : If you\'ll be lugging it around often, you might want a smaller 11-inch or 13-inch laptop. 15-inch laptops are great for the home or power users. \nBrands : If you\'re a student or just want a computer to surf the web at night, go for a Google Chromebook. These cloud-based computers, which run on Google apps (like Google Docs and Sheets), can cost less than $200. But they\'re limited, with no hard drive space. If you plan to edit photos or video, look elsewhere. Some retailers are offering discounts on MacBook Air laptops -- Best Buy is selling the 13-inch MacBook Air for $999 -- but don\'t expect major deals around Apple\'s more powerful MacBook Pro line. Don\'t expect deals on the new MacBook Pro this year. \nProcessor : According to Glaser, the best value this year is for 15-inch laptops with Skylake or Broadwell Intel processors for about $300. \n"There is a more current Intel processor (Kaby Lake), but it is mostly in high-end laptops that will be less affordable, and also more powerful than most users need," he said. \nIf you\'ll be using a computer for gaming or heavy-duty work, you\'ll want a dual-core or quad-core processor. Each core performs tasks, so a dual-core processor can handle two tasks at a time -- like browsing the web and downloading a file simultaneously -- while a quad-core can handle four and offer better performance. \nHard drives : The MacBook line starts in the 256 GB range -- perfect for the average user. If you\'re into editing photos and video, opt for something bigger, like 500 GB or even 1 TB. \nDisplay : If you\'ll be streaming a lot of Netflix, go for a crisp high-resolution screen (1080p). But sometimes display quality isn\'t a priority. \n"You don\'t go out looking for a Chromebook with 4K resolution because those laptops attract a different audience. Price and portability is more important," Shawn DuBravac, chief economist at the Consumer Electronics Association, told CNNMoney. \nThat said, 720p is still a good display option for the average consumer. \nGaming consoles and VR headsets \nSony and Microsoft have rolled out incremental system updates and complimentary accessories to hold people over until their next big console launch, likely in two years. For example, Sony is touting its new PlayStation VR set -- which has been in high demand -- to work alongside its existing PS4 or a new PS Pro consoles. \nBut the best value you\'ll find this year is with bundles -- a combo package that often includes games, gift cards and other accessories, like controllers -- when you purchase a PS4 Slim and the Xbox One S. \n"Older generation consoles will be cheaper, but not by much," Glaser said. "Budget-minded gamers should not pre-order the Playstation Pro or wait for Microsoft\'s Project Scorpio, as it will still be quite some time until they see significant discounts." \nVirtual reality headsets have been slow to hit the mainstream, but there are a ton of new and affordable options to introduce people. Google Daydream View is a solid consideration at $79, while the Samsung Gear ($60 as a standalone product) often comes bundled with phone purchases. \nOther tips \n--The Apple Store doesn\'t typically offer steep sales around the holidays, but it\'ll often throw in iTunes credit or Beats headphones with a purchase. Other retailers, such as Best Buy, Walmart and Target, do frequently discount Apple devices, while also offering gift cards and other incentives. (Target is offering a $250 gift card with an iPhone purchase this year). \n--Be aware of return policies. Some companies offer returns for only 15 or 30 days, while others extend it into the new year. \n--A lot of gift cards are given around the holidays, so stories often roll out big savings in January and February. You may want to cash in on those cards then. \n--If you see something you want, get it. "Retailers are pretty lean on inventory this year across the board," DuBravac said. "If you find a good deal, take advantage of it. Things will sell out." \n--Some retailers are vague about product details and models. For example, there are three generations of the Apple Watch -- the "original", the Series 1 and the Series 2 -- so make sure you\'re getting the one you want, even if a store doesn\'t say which model is on sale. "If you see an Apple Watch for an unbelievable price, it is probably the original, which has a slower processor," Glaser said. \n--Some companies release old products under new serial numbers just for the holidays, he added. "This means there may be no reviews or price comparisons available. We saw this from Roku last year." \nOverall, the best way to survive holiday shopping is to do your research ahead of time: Compare prices, research the trends and know what you want. \n"You should also stick to your shopping list," Glaser said. "This has the added benefit of helping you avoid impulse buys." CNNMoney (New York) First published November 23, 2016: 9:00 AM ET',

  title: 'There\'s a black working class, too',

  text: 'What about the black working class? by Tanzina Vega @tanzinavega November 23, 2016: 9:25 AM ET Wealth: America\'s other racial divide Amid all of the talk about economic populism this election cycle, one group has been largely left out:working class Americans of color. \nThe focus has been on the white working class, with the narrative of a forgotten America where rural whites once held steady factory jobs with decent wages.The economic anxiety facing black and brown workers, while arguably more profound, has been largely left out of the conversation. \nIn fact, in a CNN/Kaiser poll taken before the election, 63% of white working class respondents said they were satisfied with their personal financial situation compared to just 40% of black working class respondents. Both groups were overwhelmingly dissatisfied with the country\'s economic situation. \nThedisparities make sense considering the vast racial wealth gapin the U.S. White families, on average, tend to have 13 times more wealth than black and Latino families, according to the Pew Research Center. \nBlacks and Latinos also tend to be paid less than whites and they are also more likely to have higher rates of unemployment than whites do. They are also more likely tolive below the poverty line than whites. \nOne study by the Economic Policy Institute showed that black employees with more experience and education were still paid less than their white counterparts. Another study by the Corporation for Economic Development and the Institute for Policy Studies said if current trends persist, it would take 228 years for black families and 84 years for Latino families to accumulate the same amount of wealth as whites. \nRelated: Blacks will take hundreds of years to catch up to white wealth \nYet, the focus remains on the problems of white working class Americans. \n"In general there is a tendency to not talk about blacks as workers. This hurts the whole dialogue," said William Spriggs, chief economist for the AFL-CIO and an economics professor at Howard University. Instead, black and brown workers are considered "underclass" as opposed to working class and "lazy" instead of hardworking, said Spriggs. And yet, they too have worn overalls and lost factory jobs. \n"The notion of the white working class implicitly embodies a view of white privilege," said Spriggs, "It implies that things are supposed to be different for them, that they aren\'t the same, that they aren\'t going to face the same pressures." \nThere is no official definition of the working class. Some define it by education level or job sector, others by income. John Hudak, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution calls these voters "economically marginalized" because they often fall somewhere between the poor and the middle class. \n"The realities of race in our society and in our economy benefit white Americans over communities of color," Hudak said. \nPresident-elect Donald Trump promised to address some ofthe economic issues facing black voterswithhis New Deal for Black America , which he released in October. The ten-point plan includes a series of economic proposals that some experts say fall short of their intended goal. \nIn it, Trumpcalls for tax reforms including lowering the business tax from 35% to 15% and imposinga "massive" middle class tax cut and child care tax deductions. \nAssuming tax cuts will help communities of color is "foolish," said Hudak. "We didn\'t see massive employment creation in the 2000s following those tax cuts," Hudak said. "What we did see is massive wealth accumulation of the top earning of Americans, but we didn\'t see a trickle down effect." \nRelated: Civil rights groups biggest fears about a President Trump \nReverend Starsky Wilson, the president and chief executive of the Deaconess Foundation, a non-profit serving the children of St. Louis and a member of the Ferguson Commission, said a better way to spur economic growth would be through raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. "Those aren\'t asset building strategies, those aren\'t income building strategies," Starsky said of the Trump\'s tax plan. \nAccording to 2015 data from the Bureau of Labor statistics, 3% of white, Asian and Latino workers earned the federal minimum wage or less, compared to 4% of black workers. \nTrump also called for a "tax holiday for inner city investment," which Melina Abdullah, a professor of Pan-African Studies at California State University, Los Angeles and an organizer for the Los Angeles Black Lives Matter chapter, called "code for gentrification." She said such tax holidaysallow investors to build amenitiesthat typicallyattractmostly wealthier, white residents, therebypushing poorer, working class people of color further away from city centers. \nIn his plan, Trump also calls for financial reforms to expand credit and support new job creation, including making it easier for African-Americans to get credit to start businesses. \n"Credit is debt," said Starsky. "The community is talking about building assets, you\'re talking about building more debt. Who benefits when you offer more credit? The banks. We\'ve seen that story before," said Starsky, referring to the housing boom when blacks and Latinos were the prime targets of subprime loans. \nTrump also called for newinvestments in infrastructure as a way to create jobs , something that Democrats have had on their agenda. \nHudak said Trump\'s proposal was "a very good idea that would have meaningful effects in both white and non-white communities," but he was concerned about the emphasis on public and private partnerships to achieve that goal. "Roads are not private, ports are not private," Hudak said. "I don\'t know if the President-elect would use tax incentives in order for private companies to take over public infrastructure." \nRelated: The next battle for Black Lives Matter: Economic justice \nAbdullah was also concerned about this point. "Any time we see the term public-private partnership we should wake up. It means diverting public dollars to private corporations," she said. \nTrump also proposed canceling "all wasteful climate change spending from Obama-Clinton, including all global warming payments to the United Nations," and using the estimated savings of $100 billion over 8 years to fund urban infrastructure. \n"If you were interested in the water systems of the inner city you wouldn\'t be talking about dismantling the EPA," said Starsky of the Ferguson Commission. "The rebuilding of infrastructure is the responsibility of government." \nRepresentatives for Trump did not return requests seeking comment.

  text: 'How the Dow got to 19,000 Big banks are partying like Jamie Dimon himself was just elected president. Since Donald Trump\'s surprise victory, bank stocks have helped carry the market to new heights . The rally has been underpinned by higher interest rates but it also represents a bet that Trump will reduce big banks\' regulatory burden. \nDimon\'s bank JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) has soared 11% since Election Day. Goldman Sachs ( GS ) stock has raced up 16%, while Bank of America ( BAC ) has surged 19% and is now on track for its best month since 2012. \nEven Wells Fargo ( WFC ) , just two months removed from its fake account scandal , is up 14% since Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. \nThe post-election bank euphoria suggests that investors have forgotten, or are willing to overlook, Trump\'s anti-Wall Street stance and populist tone on the campaign trail. \nFew seem to recall that Trump advocated for breaking up big banks by reinstating the Depression era law Glass-Steagall . \nAnd the President-elect has named as his top strategist Steve Bannon, a Wall Street critic, who has blamed the 2008 global financial crisis on greedy bankers. Bannon also took issue with the fact that none of the bank execs faced criminal charges. \n"There is much more risk to the biggest banks than the market appears to appreciate," Jaret Seiberg, a Cowen & Co. analyst, wrote in a recent note. \nRelated: Trump market euphoria forgets scary campaign promises \nSeiberg urged "caution" for those who assume Trump will be a friend to big banks. In fact, he said some reforms could help regional banks at the expense of mega banks. \n"It remains unclear if the Trump administration will turn pro-big bank...or revert to its campaign stance of being anti-Wall Street," Seiberg wrote. \nWall Street seems to be banking on Trump\'s ability and willingness to repeal the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. Doing that would relieve banks of rising regulatory burdens. \nBut Chuck Schumer, the incoming Senate minority leader, said on NBC\'s Meet the Press on Sunday that he\'s got the votes to block any attempt to repeal or roll back Dodd-Frank. \nOthers wonder if Trump wants to follow through on this promise, pointing to how unpopular it would be with the Rust Belt voters of Ohio and Pennsylvania who helped fuel the billionaire\'s rise. \n"They didn\'t vote for Trump because he was going to kickstart the CDO market," Michael Block, chief market strategist at Rhino Trading, wrote in a recent note, referring to complex Wall Street securities that played a role in the financial crisis. \n"They voted for him for quite the opposite reasons, frankly. How soon we forget," Block wrote. \nRelated: JPMorgan fined for hiring kids of China\'s elite \nJames Fotheringham, analyst at BMO Capital Markets, warned investors to "curb your enthusiasm" about bank stocks. \nFotheringham does believe big banks will face less regulation due to Trump\'s victory, but he warns in a report that "Trump\'s election promise to \'repeal Dodd-Frank\' will prove an empty one." \nBMO also warns that alternatives to Dodd-Frank could hurt big banks. For instance, Jeb Hensarling, chairman of the powerful House Financial Services Committee, has championed the Financial Choice Act. The legislation would be a "negative" for big banks because it would encourage them to bulk up on lots more capital than they currently have. \nTargets in Hensarling\'s legislation suggest "significant capital shortfalls" for JPMorgan, Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley. \nSign up for CNNMoney\'s morning market newsletter: Before The Bell \nThe biggest wildcard of all would be if Trump carried out his campaign promise to bring back Glass-Steagall, the Great Depression-era law that bans banks from serving both Wall Street and Main Street. Such legislation, which the GOP included in its official platform at Trump\'s urging, would force mega banks like JPMorgan and Citi to shrink themselves. \nThe cries to shrink big banks may only grow louder after a new Financial Stability Board report this week concluded that Citi ( C ) , Wells Fargo and Bank of America all pose a greater risk to the financial system than they did last year. \n"Critics will argue this proves Dodd-Frank did not end too big to fail," Seiberg wrote. He added that it will fuel support for structural changes such as restoring the Glass-Steagall separation between commercial banking and trading. \nBannon, Trump\'s chief strategist and one of the architects of his election upset, appears to be in favor of just that. \nBannon told Buzzfeed two years ago, "You really need to go back and make banks do what they do: Commercial banks lend money, and investment banks invest in entrepreneurs and to get away from this trading." \nCNNMoney (New York)  23 AM ET',

"Different riders get on with some horses better than others but it depends on the way you ride and adapt to the horse. "I enjoy riding her. I\'m not a professional jockey so I don\'t ride that much. Pam has been very loyal to me and not taken me off her which she could quite easily have when she realized she was quite good." Actinpieces was first past the post three times over the hurdles last season and is showing promise over jumps this winter. "We really want to try and win a chase with her," says Sly who also owns the five-year-old. "She ran really well over fences at Wetherby but jumped the last, slipped and unshipped Gina." Actinpieces, seen here on her way to victory at Wetherby, and amateur jockey Gina Andrews have developed a rapport Actinpieces will resume her racing career at Wetherby, a racecourse in Yorkshire, Wednesday. "She won\'t be running in races like the Grand National or the Cheltenham Gold Cup but she\'s progressing," Andrews adds. "She\'s still one of the best I\'ve ever ridden. "She is temperamental. She only gives you one chance. You have to get it right the first time or that\'s it.

The feisty gray filly may be tricky to ride but she is also exacting and that just may be why a woman\'s touch works best.',

Where will this year\'s travel trouble lie? \nAAA projects that 48.7 million Americans will travel more than 50 miles for Thanksgiving this week. That\'s a 1.9% increase from last year, and the most since 2007. Nearly 90% of travelers, 43.5 million, will be driving to their destinations. Whether you\'re hitting the roadway or the busy skies, here\'s a look at this year\'s travel weather, starting with Wednesday. Airport Delays A storm system stretching from the Great Lakes to the Gulf Coast will bring mainly rain, but a bit of snow is possible in the Upper Midwest to the western Great Lakes. Light to moderate delays are possible due to rain in Chicago, Memphis, and perhaps Houston. Light snow on the northern side of the storm could lead to delays in Minneapolis early in the day, with a rain/snow mix causing problems in Detroit by the afternoon and evening. A storm system exiting the northeast will have some lingering strong winds capable of producing delays in Boston and New York. Midwest Read More Rain will be pushing through the Midwest and into the Ohio Valley throughout the day. Look for wet roadways from Chicago to Indianapolis, as well as into Detroit by the afternoon and evening. Snow should remain fairly light, but will affect the roadways from Minnesota to Wisconsin and northern Michigan. Northeast Much of day will feature good travel conditions across the Northeast. Light rain and snow will move into western Pennsylvania and New York during the evening. South The tail end of the storm system sweeping through the Midwest will bring some rain from Arkansas and Louisiana into Tennessee and Mississippi As the rain moves into Alabama and eastern Tennessee the rain will be dissipating West A storm system moving into the West Coast will keep things unsettled. The heaviest precipitation will be close to the coast in Washington and Oregon. Light snow is expected on Wednesday for portions of the interior Northwest from eastern Washington and Oregon into Idaho and Montana. Thanksgiving Day For those traveling on Thanksgiving Day, weather for much of the country will be fairly quiet. The weakening storm system moving into the Northeast will provide some light rain and snow for the Eastern Seaboard, especially for interior portions of New England. The Pacific Northwest will remain active with heavy rain along the Washington and Oregon coast, with snow for higher elevations into the Cascade Mountains.

We\'re back on Friday, but for now, here\'s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Doo r. \n1. School bus crash There are a lot of unanswered questions about Monday\'s bus crash that killed five children in Chattanooga, Tennessee. Here\'s a list of what we do and do not know . In an emotional interview, the mother of one of the victims told HLN that she had only recently been reunited with her son before he was killed in the crash. "There was nothing they could do for him," she said, sobbing. 2. Trump administration After canceling and then re-committing, Donald Trump had a hotly anticipated meeting with the New York Times yesterday. Here are some big takeaways from that , but in general it looks like he\'s ready to be frenemies with the media giant . Trump also delivered a long-awaited rejection of the alt-right/white nationalist groups that have been celebrating his ascent. Read More 3. Dakota Access Pipeline Protests against the oil pipeline project are getting violent. On Monday morning, a woman nearly lost her arm in an explosion , though it\'s unclear how. Other protesters say police fired concussion grenades into the crowd, but police say they didn\'t use anything explosive and instead found improvised weapons used by protesters at the scene. 4. Colombia The Colombian government will sign a long-awaited peace deal with the FARC rebel group on Thursday. This will bring an end to nearly five decades of violence and attacks from the group. The Colombian people had narrowly voted against a prior deal , because many citizens thought it was too forgiving of FARC\'s crimes. The new deal will have to go to Congress for approval, but it\'s likely to pass. 5. Thanksgiving If you\'re preparing to see family and friends this week, here are some helpful resources: How to keep an eye on tricky Thanksgiving travel spots How to handle the holidays with narcissists How to avoid ugly political conversations at the dinner table How to decide if a Black Friday deal is legit How to cook a turkey (it may be a little late for this one!)

Where\'s Hillary Clinton? Chilling at a Rhode Island bookstore , apparently. Twitter accidentally suspends their own CEO\'s account Oops, fail whale ! Meanwhile, Facebook has been reportedly working on a censorship tool And yes, it has some pretty dark implications . Marvel at the year\'s best architecture photos This one, of a reservoir in England, took top honors . And finally ...
